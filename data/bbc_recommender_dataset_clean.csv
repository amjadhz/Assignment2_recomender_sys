But bisexuality is more often hinted at or implied in cinema, and when bisexuality is mentioned by name, it’s not always exactly flattering. But just because the movies don’t feature loads of out and proud bisexuals in lead roles, doesn’t mean bisexual behaviour, coded or otherwise, isn’t a big part of cinema — whether or not the B-word is ever mentioned. Catherine Bray looks at bisexuality onscreen, to see how bisexuals have been characterised — and mischaracterised — in pop culture."

He sets his sights on dismantling the German state.","At the start of 1933, Hitler is the chancellor of Germany but he does not have absolute power - there is still a democratic parliament beneath him, a head of state above him and the rule of law hanging over him. Hitler sets his sights on dismantling the German state.  When Hitler calls a general election to increase Nazi representation in the Reichstag, Hermann Goring sees an opportunity to impress by taking out the left-wing opposition. Goring orders a raid on the Communist Party HQ in the hope of finding evidence of a planned uprising. He doesn’t find it, but when a fire breaks out in the Reichstag it is an opportunity to pin the blame on the left. Goring then has the green light to use the stormtroopers to brutally round up communists and social democrats – terror reigns in German streets.  Thousands of arrests have been made but to make them legal, Hitler calls on president von Hindenburg and a decree is passed giving the Nazis emergency powers to ban free speech, the right to protest and to arrest without charge. When the Reichstag burned the Nazis persuaded the German people and their president that this was the first sign of a left-wing insurrection. The ensuing fear of left-wing violent lawlessness means that Hitler can push through another law that suspends democracy, allowing him to act without the approval of parliament. Soon, the first laws to restrict the freedom of the Jewish population are passed. One Jewish baker is found dead with a swastika carved into his chest.  Goring has eradicated the Nazis’ parliamentary opposition. He is rewarded with more power and more prestige. Another Nazi wants this type of power and influence but in early 1933 Henrich Himmler is based in Munich, not Berlin. He is the unassuming, uncharismatic head of an elite force of fanatical Nazis known as the SS. Himmler wants to make the SS the central institution in Germany in charge of political repression. Now that Himmler can arrest perceived Nazi opponents indiscriminately, he needs somewhere to put them.  He gives a press conference regarding the opening of a camp to re-educate political prisoners. It has a capacity of around 5,000. The camp is near the small town of Dachau.  In April 1933 a 39-year-old deputy state prosecutor called Josef Hartinger receives a telephone call. Four detainees have tried to escape from the camp at Dachau, three have been shot dead. Under German law it is Hartinger’s job to investigate these unnatural deaths. He visits Dachau and sees the bodies - he realises something is very wrong. The official story just doesn’t add up and it is strange that all the dead happen to be Jewish. Hartinger is sure these deaths are murders and that they are not an isolated case. He collates enough evidence to implicate the commandant of Dachau in the murders.    This means going up against Himmler, whose power is growing. Himmler is in the process of bringing every state in Germany under SS control. He does not want the wider world to know that Dachau is a place of savage brutality and murder.  Hartinger’s boss will not go against Himmler’s authority and shuts his deputy down but Hartinger will not be silenced and files a report. Himmler is worried - the SS does not have the right under German law to kill political opponents. To placate his critics, Himmler fires the commandant and as far as the German public are concerned the concentration camps are benign and humane.  Hartinger’s file goes all the way to Berlin and the killings stop at Dachau – it seems like a victory for the law. But Himmler is starting to impress, and he manages to persuade Hitler to block the legal investigations into Dachau. Now Himmler and the SS feel emboldened and the killings continue.  Göring realises he has to take Himmler seriously and that his grip on power could be under threat, but he has his own secret weapon. He has created a surveillance organisation that listens in on anyone that could move against him. To act on the information gathered, Goring creates a new branch of the secret police, known as the Gestapo.  But Himmler wants Goring’s secret police – this is after all his territory. Goring will not relinquish control. These rivalries mean nothing to Hitler - books are being burned, Jewish people, gay people, intellectuals, anyone held to have anti-Nazi beliefs are disappearing.  Germany is well on its way to becoming a Nazi dictatorship, but there is a serious obstacle in Hitler’s way: the country’s elderly president."

Astronomers are on the brink of finding other worlds the same size as earth and the same distance from their star. Professor Brian Cox considers what it is about our world that has made it a home and asks what ingredients are necessary to turn a tiny spec of rock in space into a living, vibrant planet. To find out, Brian has come to one of earth's richest and most bio-diverse territories, Mexico. He begins by diving in search of our most essential ingredient in a beautiful azure sink hole or cenote, a characteristic feature and primary water source in southern Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. He then travels aboard the spectacular Copper Canyon Railway to measure the impact that the sun has on our planet, discovering how early life had to learn to survive under its glare in ways that still survive in us all today.  At the end of the train journey, he arrives in Mexico's beautiful mountain interior, where he uncovers how the relationship life has with the sun has led to one on the most astonishing of all life's inventions: photosynthesis. By turning sunlight into energy,  life has tapped a seemingly endless energy source and introduces a vital ingredient to the planet's atmosphere - oxygen. Finally, Brian visits a remote enclave high up in the pine forests of central Mexico to witness one of nature's greatest sights, the arrival of the monarch butterflies. Each year they make one of the longest migrations of all the butterfly species, over 4,000 kilometres from northern Canada to Mexico, by tapping into one the most elusive, intangible and perhaps rarest planetary ingredients of them all."

To stop it ever happening again they set out to find ways to control this hidden enemy within the human mind.Sigmund Freud's daughter, Anna, and his nephew, Edward Bernays, provided the centrepiece philosophy. The US government, big business, and the CIA used their ideas to develop techniques to manage and control the minds of the American people. But this was not a cynical exercise in manipulation. Those in power believed that the only way to make democracy work and create a stable society was to repress the savage barbarism that lurked just under the surface of normal American life."

By living amongst them for a week, what will he discover about the extremes of this misunderstood country in the 21st century? South Africa is a country devoted to God, and Pentecostal 'Megachurches' are booming. But as well as conventional priests and bishops, thousands of young people follow self-styled prophets. Reggie spends a week with one of the most controversial and colourful of them all, Prophet Mboro. In a world of witchcraft, exorcisms and heavily armed guards, Mboro is adored by the thousands of followers in his megachurch and renowned as much for his dancing as the 'miracles' he performs. Reggie has already rejected African Pentecostal faith once in his life and now he tries to discover whether a multimillionaire king of bling with 30 flash cars can really be a messenger from God. But the deeper Reggie digs, the more conflicted he becomes- until he starts to confront some truths much closer to home."

It has deep forests and vast mountain ranges, and a third of it sits above the Arctic Circle.The whole state goes through some of the most extreme seasonal changes: temperatures can reach into the 90s F in summer and can plummet to -80F in the winter.Yet plenty survives here, and it is home to some of the hardiest animals on the planet. Each one has its own quirky way of getting through the challenges of the seasons. Above all, this is a land of great characters.We meet black bear cubs faced with a daunting climb down from their tree-den and a mother sea otter nursing her baby through the chilly days of early spring. Stealthy 50-tonne sperm whales steal fish from the end of fishermen's lines in an extraordinary marine 'heist', grizzly bears grow big on a sudden wealth of salmon and a huge male moose finds unlikely ways to impress a female. Thousands of bald eagles gather for a winter feast, and arctic foxes risk everything to find food in the alien world of an oil boomtown. People, too, must go with the flow of the extreme seasons, facing winter storms at sea to catch snow crabs, rushing across ice rivers with teams of huskies and taking advantage of Alaska's endless summer daylight to grow world-class giant vegetables.No season brings more surprises than an Alaskan summer. It lures hummingbirds up from the tropics, exposes deserts in the Arctic and relies on parachuting firefighters to tackle forest fires in its vast wilderness. Summer is a narrow window of plenty, when the land is bathed in 24-hour sunlight - but in this land of extremes, you can have too much of a good thing."

Lucy examines the reign of Catherine the Great and the conflict with Napoleonic France.,"Lucy Worsley continues her journey through Russia in the footsteps of the Romanovs, the most powerful royal dynasty in modern European history. In this episode she examines the extraordinary reign of Catherine the Great, and the traumatic conflict with Napoleonic France that provides the setting for the novel War and Peace.Lucy begins in the 18th century, when the great palaces of the Romanovs were built. But in Romanov Russia, blood was always intermingled with the gold - these splendid interiors were the backdrop to affairs, coups and murder.At the magnificent palace of Peterhof near St Petersburg, Lucy charts the meteoric rise of Catherine the Great, who seized the Russian throne from her husband Peter III in 1762 and became the most powerful woman in the world. Catherine was a woman of huge passions - for art, for her adopted country (she was German by birth) and for her many lovers. Lucy visits the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg, once the home of Catherine's vast art collection. Here she explores how, once Catherine had taken the throne, she compensated for her foreign origins by taking careful control of her image, using her portraits and clothes to create a brand that looked authentically Russian yet also modern and sophisticated. Lucy tells how Catherine expanded her empire through military victories overseas, while at home she encouraged education and introduced smallpox inoculation to Russia. But Catherine struggled to introduce deeper reforms, and the institution of serfdom remained largely unchanged. Lucy explains how this injustice fuelled a violent rebellion. Nevertheless, Catherine left Russia more powerful on the world stage than ever. But all she had achieved looked set to be undone when Napoleon invaded Russia in 1812. Lucy relives the pivotal battle of Borodino, when the Russian army finally confronted the French forces the traumatic destruction of Moscow and, under Catherine's grandson Alexander, the eventual victory over the French that provided the Romanov dynasty with its most glorious hour."

Following groups of wildlife, including hippos, baboons, catfish, kingfishers, leopards, warthogs and elephants, the film reveals how the yearly flood transforms the landscape and impacts their lives.

If they find it, this could transform our understanding of the nature and fabric of our universe. The problem is, these tiny particles are almost impossible to detect.Elsewhere, physicists conduct experiments in some of the most extreme environments on the planet: from deep mine shafts in South Dakota to vast ice fields at the South Pole. In these unlikely places supersized neutrino detectors hope to unlock the universe’s deepest secrets. Could neutrinos overturn the most precise theory of particle physics that humans have ever written down? Could they even be a link to a hidden realm of new particles that permeate the cosmos – so called dark matter? Scientists at Fermilab are edging towards the truth."

This is the next stage in the family’s journey following the Bafta- award winning and critically acclaimed 2017 documentary, ‘Rio Ferdinand: Being Mum and Dad’. Two years after Rebecca’s passing, Rio also lost his mum, Janet, to cancer. So in the months leading up to their wedding, this deeply personal film will look at the emotionally complicated dilemmas this newly formed family unit face following the family’s double bereavement. For 27 year old Kate, taking on not only the role as Rio’s new partner, but also of ‘mum’ to three grieving children, and with the memory of Rebecca and Janet still very much present, a unique set of emotionally complicated challenges emerge. Stepfamilies are now the fastest growing family type in the UK. It's estimated that 1 in 3 of all families are now blended families. In search of answers, Kate and Rio meet other step-parents willing to share their experiences at one of the support groups on offer, Happy Steps, led by Professor Lisa Doodson, a chartered psychologist specialising in stepfamily dynamics.  As Rio and Kate open up about their own experiences, they learn they’re not alone and that stepfamilies often have to overcome challenges when developing their new family units which can affect their mental wellbeing, with increased stress and anxiety, particularly for stepmums. But whilst Rio and Kate start to explore some of their own questions around step-parenting, they still aren’t sure how the three children are coping with the loss of both grandmother Janet and their mum Rebecca.  On visiting a specialist child bereavement charity, Rio and Kate hear from other children who have lost a parent and now have a new step-parent in their lives. Listening to the powerful advice from these young people, Rio realises that he’s working too hard, and that Kate probably spends more time with the kids than he does.  Armed with new knowledge from these support groups, Kate and Rio make positive changes to their lives, before taking Tate, Tia and Lorenz to Child Bereavement UK so they can also benefit from hearing from other young people who have lost a parent."

He tells how the Normans established their new province of Normandy -'land of the northmen' - in northern France. They went on to build some of the finest churches in Europe and turned into an unstoppable force of Christian knights and warriors, whose legacy is all around us to this day. Under the leadership of Duke William, the Normans expanded into the neighbouring provinces of northern France. But William's greatest achievement was the conquest of England in 1066. The Battle of Hastings marked the end of the Anglo-Saxon aristocracy and monarchy. The culture and politics of England would now be transformed by the Normans."

As a young child of two, Maureen was diagnosed with polio and was placed into quarantine for several months before being released just before Christmas. The disease left her unable to walk and she received a very special present, a mechanical walking 'Susie' doll. While Maureen slowly learned to walk again, Susie was there encouraging her every step of the way. Seventy years later, Susie can no longer walk, her mechanism has seized and she is looking the worse for wear, while Maureen is now suffering from post-polio syndrome, a little-known condition that causes the symptoms of polio to return many years after the original infection. As Maureen is losing the use of her legs again, she would love to see Susie returned to full working and walking order. It’s a Christmas mission for the bear ladies Amanda Middleditch and Julie Tatchell, with the mechanical help of horologist Steve Fletcher.A multi-layered traditional wooden Nativity scene originally brought in by Sophie Harrison has metal worker Dom and wood expert Will in a bit of a spin. This ornament has been a feature of family Christmases for as long as Sophie can remember, a gift from her French grandfather Claude to her mum Marie-Claude. Sophie hopes that Dom and Will can get this festive ornament turning again so she can share it this Christmas with her father and her own children.The next item through the barn doors has supplied the soundtrack to Christmases past for several generations of a West Country farming community. Mother and daughter Jane and Amy Price have brought in a 100-year-old harmonium pump organ that belonged to their father and grandfather, Ronald Frost. Every Christmas at the family dairy farm in Somerset, Ronald would manhandle the harmonium onto the back of a farm trailer pulled by a tractor and head into the village accompanied by farm workers, villagers and a fair few tankards of cider singing Christmas carols. On hand to get this ancient instrument ready for future Christmases is organ expert David Burville with help from leather expert Suzie Fletcher.Finally, a toy that has travelled thousands of miles in its lifetime, but which now needs the electronic know-how of Mark Stuckey to get it back on track. This ageing toy train set was once the centrepiece of a Christmas window display in a grocer’s shop in 1960s Kenya. Kids would come from miles around to watch the train, but two young boys were lucky enough to be given the train set once Christmas was over – the shop owner's son Deepak Parmer and his cousin Nilesh. This treasured toy came with the boys when they moved to the UK with their families in the early 70s and has stayed with Deepak ever since, even though it hasn’t worked for years. Secret Santa has again challenged every expert to create a gift from scratch for one of their barn mates. As secret plans are made in each nook and cranny of the barn, inspired creations begin to emerge, including a gingerbread replica of the Repair Shop."

Ian Hislop's Stiff Upper Lip - An Emotional History of Britain,Documentaries,"BBC, iPlayer, TV, Ian Hislops Stiff Upper Lip - An Emotional History of Britain, 1. Emergence",Charting how the stiff upper lip emerged in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p0btllqr.jpg,59 mins,3560,9pm 2 Oct 2012,Charting how the stiff upper lip emerged in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.,Ian Hislop investigates Britain's emotional history. He charts how and why the stiff upper lip emerged in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.,"Ian Hislop asks when and why we British have bottled up or let out our feelings and how this has affected our history.Revealing as much about ourselves today as about our past, this is a narrative history of emotion and identity over the last three hundred years, packed with extraordinary characters, fascinating vignettes and much humour, illuminated through the lens of culture - novels, paintings, magazines, cartoons, film and television - from which Ian gives his personal take on our evolving national character. Far from being part of our cultural DNA, emotional restraint was a relatively recent national trait. Foreigners in Tudor England couldn't believe how touchy-feely we could be - 'wherever you move there is nothing but kisses' wrote a shocked Erasmus. In this opening episode, Ian Hislop charts how and why the stiff upper lip emerged in the late 18th and early 19th century in a country till then often awash with sentiment.In 18th-century British society, public emoting was a sign of refinement and there was a vogue for all things sentimental. It was very much the done thing for women and men to weep at Samuel Richardson's novels or have Johann Zoffany paint their portraits to highlight their tenderness and sensitivity. But Ian reveals that a new idea - politeness - paved the way for the emergence of the stiff upper lip by prizing consistency of behaviour over emotional honesty. To illustrate this he plunders the candid diary of James Boswell, an aspirational young Scot plagued with anxieties about how far he should show his feelings in fashionable London. Ian also tells the story of early feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, who famously argued that women's heads should rule their hearts, but failed to practise what she preached when she fell in love with a dashing but dastardly American.Ian argues that, strange as it may seem, we have the French to thank for our stiff upper lip - the horrors of the French Revolution and the threat from Napoleon teaching the British ruling classes just where rampant emotional expression might lead. Instead, the new breed of British heroes became men with admirable self-control, like Jane Austen's Mr Knightley, who famously tells Emma 'If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more.'This was a time of profound transition for Britain - and how it expressed its feelings - which Ian encapsulates with the tale of two national heroes - Nelson and Wellington. Admiral Nelson was the last 18th-century buccaneering adventurer - flamboyant, philandering, a man whose shameless sentimentality bolstered his huge popularity. His death-bed plea for an embrace from his best friend was so shocking to the Victorians a generation later that they changed 'kiss me, Hardy' to 'kismet'. By contrast, the Iron Duke, Wellington, was the prototype for the cool, calm and collected Brit. And it was Wellington, not Nelson, who would become the pre-eminent role model for the Victorians. As Ian tracks the emergence of the stiff upper lip, he finds himself playing cricket on the Champs Élysées and discovers some 200-year-old merchandising David Beckham would be proud of. Along the way AN Wilson, Thomas Dixon and John Mullan help Ian get the measure of how our upper lips stiffened."

David Olusoga traces the bitter propaganda war waged between the pro-slavery lobby and the abolitionists.,"Historian David Olusoga continues his examination of Britain's forgotten slave owners. In this episode, David explores how in 1834 the government arrived at the extraordinary decision to compensate the slave owners with the equivalent of £17 billion in today's money. Tracing the bitter propaganda war waged between the pro-slavery lobby and the abolitionists, he reveals that paying off the slave owners for the loss of their human property was, ultimately, the only way to bring the system to an end.Meticulously kept records held at the National Archives detail the names of the 46,000 slave owners from across the British empire who had a slice of this vast handout. Combined with new research, shared exclusively with the BBC by University College London, it reveals more about Britain's slave owners than we've ever known before.Of the 46,000 names in the 1834 compensation records, 3,000 lived in Britain, yet they owned half of the slaves across the empire and pocketed half of the compensation money. These include members of the clergy and of the House of Lords. The records also show that at the point of abolition, more than 40 per cent of all the slave owners were women.David goes on to investigate what happened to the wealth generated by the slave system and compensation pay out. He reveals aspects of Britain's spectacular industrialisation in the 19th century, the consolidation of the City of London as a world centre of finance, and a number of the country's most well-known institutions that all have links to slave-derived wealth.Ultimately, David discovers that the country's debt to slavery is far greater than previously thought, shaping everything from the nation's property landscape to its ideas about race. A legacy that can still be felt today."

But imagine if every single item in your home were laid out before you, so you could decide what to keep and what to lose. Tidying guru extraordinaire Stacey Solomon has put together a crack team of organising fanatics who will help a family transform their messy home through a life-changing declutter and a budget-friendly makeover. After spending far too long in our houses, it’s time for a supersized spring clean!Stacey and her gang (organiser Dilly, carpenter Rob and cleaner Iwan) challenge the Yaku family to sort their life out in seven days – and in order to do this, they’ll have to embark on a mammoth declutter. Stacey asks the family to try to let go of half their possessions, so they can then reorganise the house.We get to know the family behind the clutter – hospital director Tash, tube driver Lawrence and their four kids - and find out why their home is making them miserable. There are emotional moments as the family go through treasured items, and friction develops as they must decide what to part with. The items they do decide to let go of will be put into piles to recycle, donate or sell.   Rob breathes new life into some of the family’s most precious household items and offers up ingenious storage solutions, such as hidden drawers in stairs and making a work station from an old kitchen pantry. Iwan gives the home a supersized spring clean, with lots of useful tips along the way, and Dilly shows us all the best way to sort our kids' toys and kitchen cupboards. When the family are left with only the must-keep items, the house is stylishly refilled by Stacey and her team, ready for the big reveal. Have they really managed to transform the home by decluttering, organising and upcycling alone?"

Spanning performance, animation, interviews (including with artist Bob and Roberta Smith), text and original music composition, the 14-minute video-essay is a whirlwind of eight exercises for the body and mind.  Playful yet poignant, coy yet in-your-face, poetic yet pungent, it argues that in such times of despair, art can remind us to imagine how things can be, and that each of us must play an active part. Drawing on the words of Lorde, Bretch, Beckett, Abdelkader Benali and more, it calls on viewers to (re-)imagine, and act on, how things can become. The film builds on the director’s efforts since the pandemic, which are advancing conversations around creativity and neurodiversity, and the socio-political role of ‘artfulness’.Be prepared to be disorientated, surprised, provoked, and re-energised.

In 2006 and again in 2011, Louis uncovered a world of indoctrination masterminded by church-founder and figurehead Pastor Fred Phelps, known amongst his congregation as Gramps. But since his death in 2014, the church has experienced a significant change that has threatened to tear apart what was once a tight-knit family community and challenged their relevance in Trump’s America, where outrageous statements are par for the course. As well as a series of allegations about Pastor Phelps’s final days, including rumours of mental illness and his excommunication, the church has also been hit by a number of high-profile family defections, including Pastor Phelps's granddaughter Megan, now Westboro’s most prominent critic. Yet despite the unrest, the church has continued to attract new members, including Bradford-born Mathias Holroyd, who sees Westboro’s fire-and-brimstone rhetoric as the perfect tonic to his struggle to fit in with modern-day Britain. Immersing himself in the strange and unpleasant world of Westboro, Louis explores what happens when a hate-group largely populated by one family loses its patriarch. And, as he discovers, Pastor Phelps’s doctrine of divine hate has cast a shadow not only on the church's true-believers but also on those who have managed to escape Westboro's vice-like grip."

The trial sees, for the first time ever under controlled conditions, a psychedelic drug tested head-to-head against a standard antidepressant as a treatment for depression.  The film follows a pioneering team of scientists and psychotherapists, led by Professor David Nutt, Dr Robin Carhart-Harris and Dr Rosalind Watts, as they compare the effects of psilocybin (the active ingredient of magic mushrooms) with an antidepressant (an SSRI called escitalopram) on a small group of participants with clinical depression. This is scientific research at its most cutting edge. With over seven million people being prescribed antidepressants each year in England alone, this drug trial is an important milestone in understanding a completely different treatment for depression. Filmed over 16 months, this film explores both the immediate and long-term impacts of the trial on the lives of participants. It investigates whether psychedelic drugs combined with psychological support could help tackle one of the biggest medical challenges faced today and what it takes to conduct research in uncharted scientific territory.How do psychedelic drugs measure up against the industry-standard antidepressants that have been popular since the 1990s? The empirical results of the trial are explored alongside the participants’ powerful lived experience."

It is the story of an extraordinary man, an English, World Cup-winning legend who became an Irish hero.Jack Charlton won the World Cup in 1966 playing alongside his brother, Bobby, in England’s greatest ever side. A proud Englishman, Jack applied for only one job in his subsequent career as a football manager: the England job. Jack never received a reply from the FA. Instead, he accepted an invitation to manage the Republic of Ireland, and took on a side that had never qualified for a major tournament to the dizzying heights of a World Cup quarter-final.In doing so he inspired a nation. Ireland’s footballing success represented far more than winning matches, it influenced a social and cultural change in a country that faced deep-seated political and economic challenges.Finding Jack Charlton tells the story of Jack’s special association with Ireland and also examines his frustration with England and the FA, his complicated relationship with his brother Sir Bobby Charlton, and his final battle with dementia.Offering an intimate, compelling insight into Jack the man, Finding Jack Charlton includes contributions from Jack’s family, his wife Pat and son John, alongside celebrated Irish players, musicians, writers and politicians, including Larry Mullen Jr, Roddy Doyle, Brendan O’Carroll, Paul McGrath, Niall Quinn, Mick McCarthy, David O’Leary and Andy Townsend."

Intended as a vaccine for the world, did politics get in its way?","Celebrated as our national jab, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been praised as a 'remarkable example of British innovation and scientific excellence' and recognised for its success at home. Around half of all adults in the UK received two doses of it.But when Oxford scientists developed the jab, they had far greater ambitions: a 'vaccine for the world', designed specifically to be distributed to lower income countries and sold at cost for the duration of the pandemic. For both humanitarian and scientific reasons, they argued sharing vaccines fairly globally was the best way to bring coronavirus under control.A year later, more than 2.5 billion doses have been distributed worldwide. But with only one in 20 people in low income countries double jabbed and the Omicron variant spreading globally, how far did the vaccine meet its original purpose?Beset by challenges including supply disputes in Europe and, concerns over rare blood clots, the vaccine has never been approved in the US and is now barely used in the UK. So how much were these problems self-inflicted, or did nationalist politics get in the way?The BBC’s medical editor, Fergus Walsh, who has been reporting on the vaccine since its early development, examines the challenges this jab faced in Europe and beyond, and asks if it fulfilled the original hopes of the scientists in Oxford."

Without them the NHS would have been in danger of collapse - not least during the current COVID crisis - but from the very start the story of this beloved British institution has been intertwined with one of the most divisive social and political issue of the age, immigration. The people who came to this country to work in the NHS have found themselves fighting battles they neither sought nor expected.Today, more than 13 per cent of the 1.2 million people who work for the NHS are from overseas, representing 200 different nationalities, and in England and Wales more than 40 per cent can claim minority ethnic heritage, making the NHS the most diverse of all British institutions. The programme gives voice to the moving and often raw experiences of nurses from the Irish Republic, the Caribbean and the Philippines, GPs and surgeons from India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka and paramedics from Central Europe, as well as to the British-born children and grandchildren of immigrants who have found themselves helping and healing with one hand while fending off the sharp end of discrimination and racism with the other.

Freddie reveals how bulimia has played a part in the course of his life. He discusses his experience in visceral detail and meets specialists and young men with eating disorders across the UK. Together they challenge, with incredible honesty and humility, some of the stereotypes that men and boys in their position face – that is, suffering with a serious mental health condition that is perceived to be something ‘only girls get’ – and finally give a public voice to a much-misunderstood illness.  Experts estimate that over 1.5 million people in the UK have an eating disorder like bulimia, of which 25 per cent are male. And yet eating disorders are still considered to be illnesses that only teenage girls suffer with. As a result, boys and men with eating disorders most often live in silence with the double stigma of having a mental health condition that is not recognised in their gender.  Ultimately, Freddie must ask himself whether he needs professional treatment to tackle his eating disorder once and for all."

They were working hard and counting on providing better opportunities and education for their children. However, in a white-dominated country, where the politics were becoming increasingly racialised, there was a question of how society, and its teachers, saw these young black children.Before having a chance to develop intellectually, they were labelled as stupid, difficult and disruptive. The paradox is that many of the new migrants to Britain were in fact highly educated. One of them was Gus John, who arrived from Trinidad as a Dominican novitiate to become a priest. Almost immediately he was contacted by some black parents worried about the schooling of their children. Together with several other educators, John quickly realised that the system was not just inept, but actually rigged against black children. At the same time, celebrity psychologists Hans Eysenck and Arthur Jensen were propounding theories that black people were genetically less intelligent than white people. These theories infiltrated teacher training and found their way into schools. IQ tests were then based on these theories with the odds horrendously stacked against children from the West Indies."

In his role of Ranger he shows us around the Windsor estate, and describes what it was like when he first arrived in 1952: how he transformed the castle inside and out how he handled the old guard his biggest bug-bear, the tree-huggers his successes and (very messy) failures as an ecopioneer how he turned Windsor into a home fit for a young and growing family what is was like following in the footsteps of his predecessor and ancestor Prince Albert he tells us about his love of polo and the real reason he built a polo club on the grounds, and how he wrote the rules for carriage-driving- the sport he never gave up. And he even touches on his own place in history, and his firm belief that it is for others to decide his legacy… There is relaxed banter with the film crew, funny off-camera exchanges (which we include), but there are also serious and at times some very poignant and reflective moments. And all this at the place he calls home-which of course will be his final resting place too. This is the real Duke, in his own words, a unique and enduring portrait which reveals the side of a man rarely seen."

This vivid and moving film for BBC Two collates the memories of survivors, the bereaved, firefighters, safety experts and the politicians linked to five intensely fierce fire disasters that preceded Grenfell. This telling collection of interviews and archive footage shows the clear warnings that existed and could have predicted a Grenfell-type inferno happening in Britain.The programme focuses on three factors: the application of flammable material and cladding to buildings, the 'stay put' advice given by fire services, the absence of sprinklers - and how they contributed to each of the previous five blazes, sometimes with fatal consequences. Made over the course of 12 months, the film tells the story of the legislative history of building regulations from 1973 to the present day through five fires. It explores the causes, subsequent investigations and the recommendations that were sent to successive UK governments, ultimately posing the question: if lessons had been learned as a result of tragic repetition of errors over the decades, could Grenfell have been avoided?The five fires revisited include the Summerland disaster, Douglas, Isle of Man (1973), Knowsley Heights fire, Liverpool (1991), Garnock Court fire, Irvine, N Ayrshire (1999), Harrow Court fire, Stevenage, Herts (2005), and Lakanal House, London (2009)."

The guests were celebrity snapper Ray Bellasario and comedy actor Terry-Thomas. Seen as a temporary ten-week filler programme, it went on to record over 650 episodes featuring interviews with over 2,000 guests and was voted by the BFI one of the top ten UK television programmes of all time.This programme tells the full story of the humble beginnings of the show and how it rose to become an award-winning Saturday night staple, a source of water-cooler moments before that phrase had even been thought of. It tells the story of how Michael left Fleet Street and stumbled into television at Granada, where he made his first attempt at celebrity interviewing in an encounter with Mick Jagger. Poached by the BBC, he then found himself hosting the show that would make his name, and he recounts how the success of the show was secured by convincing Orson Welles to appear, as well as how the first series was wiped, losing interviews with John Lennon and Yoko Ono amongst others.It was a time when the likes of Jimmy Cagney, Fred Astaire, Lauren Bacall and Ingrid Bergman could be interviewed in depth for the first time, though the show developed into something more than just a celebrity gabfest. Michael reveals some tricks of the interview trade and remembers some of his favourite moments, including his encounters with Muhammad Ali and Billy Connolly, as well as some less successful meetings with Meg Ryan and Helen Mirren. He also explains his decision to leave the interview game in 2008."

On 9 October 1986, nine-year-old friends Karen Hadaway and Nicola Fellows went out to play and didn't come home. The whole estate turned out to look for the two girls only to have their hopes dashed when they were found lying dead in undergrowth in Wild Park, on the outskirts of Brighton. Both had been strangled and sexually assaulted.For their families it was the start of a living hell. Police arrested a man the girls liked and trusted - 20-year-old Russell Bishop - and in 1987 he was put on trial. But the jury took less than two hours to acquit him of the murders. Under the law at the time, Bishop could not be retried even if new evidence were to be found. The families of the murdered girls had to endure years of agony, without any prospect of justice for their lost children. Until 2005, when the double jeopardy law was abolished, rekindling the hopes of the families.Now police and scientists are using cutting-edge methods to uncover new evidence, which they hope will be enough for the CPS to pursue a fresh prosecution. Following the reinvestigation and proceedings from an early stage, and sharing the experience of the children's families, this film charts the last chance at finally finding justice for Karen and Nicola."

Oli, 21, lives in London and has two mums, who conceived him using an anonymous sperm donor in California. Oli always knew he was donor conceived but is curious about his biology. Signing up to a website that helps children of sperm donors find each other, Oli receives an email from someone called Jordan, who reveals she is Oli’s half-sister and breaks the news that their donor, Daley, has revoked his anonymity. Then she drops the real bombshell: Oli has 25 American half brothers and sisters.  Oli virtually meets his new extended family, who are excited about the latest addition to their network. Within days, their online relationship becomes strained, as Oli’s strong opinions clash with those of his siblings. Oli was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome aged 12. He grew up an only child and sometimes found it hard to fit in and make friends.  Oli decides to travel to America, hoping that building relationships will be easier in person.

Each of the siblings he visits has their own extraordinary story, which is revealed along the way. Will Oli return to London with some lasting sibling relationships?

Inextricably entwined and icons of their age, they were both creative powerhouses and gay men, who dealt with success and its evanescence in vastly different ways.Film-maker Lisa Immordino Vreeland brings these two forces together in a unique and fascinating head-to-head, comparing and contrasting their trajectories through duelling voices – the writers’ own, culled from archival footage, and those of actors Jim Parsons and Zachary Quinto, who portray Capote and Williams at various stages of their lives. Both writers constructed rich, imaginary worlds and characters - Blanche DuBois and Holly Golightly to mention just two - which left indelible marks on the era. Both men also paid the price of colossal success and fame, suffering alcoholism and periods of artistic stagnation."

Orpheus is alone, playing tunes in his record shop, when a visit from an enigmatic stranger sets music, myth and his own fragile reality into a spin. Driven by an astonishing original soundtrack of hip-hop, soul and funk, he ventures back into the past to confront some painful truths in the hope of reconciling himself with his future.  Inspired by ancient Greek myth, acclaimed rapper and playwright Testament fuses spoken word and beatboxing with a cinematic score performed by members of the Orchestra and Chorus of Opera North.   In an extraordinary feat of storytelling and musicianship, Testament fills an empty theatre with Orpheus’s dreams, reminiscences and struggle for redemption. The result is a compelling examination of isolation and an affirmation of the need for kindness and empathy, and of trust in the redemptive power of music.A Leeds Playhouse and Opera North co-production premiered to a socially distanced audience in October 2020, Orpheus in the Record Shop returned to the locked-down Leeds Playhouse in early 2021 to be reworked for this new film."

This warm and honest documentary reveals how everyday people feel about the climate crisis.,"Britain has made big promises about reducing our impact on the planet, but getting there means huge changes to our everyday lives. In this surprising and funny documentary, we follow members of the UK’s first ever Citizen's Assembly on Climate Change, where 108 ordinary Brits are tasked with deciding what we should do to meet our climate change goals. Organised by Parliament, this historic event sees members of the public grapple with big questions about our future. As the assembly members learn the science of climate change from experts and hear Sir David Attenborough thank them for giving up their time for this task, they begin to realise the huge significance of the decisions they must make.The film follows seven assembly members from all over the UK, who each bring their own perspective to the climate change debate. Sue, an ex-fishmonger from Bath, is shocked to learn the science of climate change, and when floods hit the UK - and the south west in particular - she begins to understand how close to home these issues can be and resolves to make personal changes. British Gas employee Marc from Newcastle is enthusiastic about taking part in the assembly, but is worried about losing his job in the transition to green energy, while 27-year-old postal worker Amy is unsettled when she learns the environmental impact of the coal fire she heats her home with. We also meet retired printer Richard, who is sceptical about climate change and reluctant to accept many of the proposals put forward in the assembly. But when his own health deteriorates, he is forced to re-examine the impact of dirty air on all our lives.Through this cast of warm, funny Brits, we understand the challenge we all face in the effort to reduce climate change and start to see what the future might look like in a greener world."

Featuring eyewitnesses speaking for the first time, this documentary aims to find out what really happened.","On 23 March 2021, the Ever Given – one of the largest container ships ever built – ploughed into the sandy bank of the Suez Canal, blocking the entire waterway. It stopped all traffic in one of the most important shipping lanes in the world for almost a week, causing a ‘ship jam’ of over 300 vessels and delaying deliveries of billions of pounds of vital food, fuel and medical supplies. The disruption to the global supply chain lasted for months.How did such an advanced ship crash in one of the most closely monitored shipping lanes in the world? How did a team of engineers free the ship in just six days? And who or what is to blame?Using never-before seen footage, testimony from witnesses speaking for the very first time, and expert analysis, this documentary aims to uncover the inside story of the Ever Given accident. And with over 2,500 shipping incidents a year, the film also asks if this was just a freak accident or whether it reveals a serious weakness in the world’s critical supply chain."

But fame and a luxury lifestyle haven’t been able to heal the grief he has kept inside for 20 years. Now, as he turns 30, Joey wants to embark on a deeply personal journey to take stock of his life and, for the sake of his future, finally confront his past.Every year, 41,00 young people lose a parent in the UK. At the age of just ten, Joey's world was ripped apart when his mum tragically took her own life. Unable to comprehend the loss, Joey has spent the next 20 years of his life burying his grief. He has kept his emotions hidden, rarely spoken about his mother and avoided having pictures of her in his home. But now, as he leaves his twenties behind, he is ready to confront his trauma so he can move forward with his life.With the help of a clinical psychologist, Dr Stephen Blumenthal, Joey sets out to finally face the impact his beloved mother’s death has had on him. Up until now, he has only really opened up about his childhood with his family, but even his sister Frankie and cousin Chloe recognise that he has never truly processed his feelings or fully faced his bereavement. Opening up to a psychologist and learning to trust Stephen will be a tough first step.From talking about his emotions to putting more pictures of his mum around his house and finding a way of coping with his anxiety, Joey is determined to face his fears head on. After an unsure start and trust issues threaten to derail the process, he realises that to be able to move on with his life he has to look back at his past. But after 20 years of living this way, can Joey Essex really come to terms with his grief?"

The only living British author to hold the Nobel Prize in Literature, Ishiguro’s novels and short stories have been translated into more than fifty languages. Two of his most popular novels, The Remains of the Day and Never Let Me Go, have also enjoyed success as star-studded film adaptations.  In this revealing profile, Ishiguro explores the significance of his early life in Nagasaki and the experience of growing up in the aftermath of the atomic bomb. He shares memories of feeling like the only Japanese boy in the home counties of England in the early 1960s, and how this helped to shape his viewpoint as a writer. As a young man, he harboured ambitions to be a singer-songwriter, and he shares his lifelong emotional connection to music and lyrics, and the impact that particular songs have had on his writing.  Alongside contributions from writers Hanya Yanagihara and Bernardine Evaristo, as well as Ai-Da, an AI robot artist, Ishiguro charts the development of his work across the four decades of his writing career. He discusses the recurring themes of memory, history and the redemptive power of love, and reveals how he has turned his gaze to the future for his much-anticipated new book, Klara and the Sun."

In the shadow of the civil rights movement and the Troubles, the club managed to keep playing - until the team bus of Ballymena United was caught up in the violence, taken away and burned. Derry City FC was banned from playing at home and eventually went out of business.In 1984, the city needed a saviour. Tony O’Doherty was a Northern Ireland international who had played against England at Wembley. He teamed up with another international, Terry Harkin, and two other professionals Eddie Mahon and Eamonn McLaughlin, to become the Gang of Four who challenged the status quo. They made it their goal to get senior football back in their hometown. With repeated rebuffs from the Irish League in Belfast to their requests to gain re-entry, the four lads decided to take their footballing revolution south to the League of Ireland in Dublin. This film charts the emotional journey of how in 1985, after 13 years in the wilderness, football returned to the Brandywell. The club would go on to lift both silverware and the spirits of the city, unleashing a carnival of hope, pride and optimism.Featuring interviews with the Gang of Four, rare archive footage and memories of the faithful supporters, the film portrays an inspirational group of people who made their dreams come true. The rollercoaster took the club and community from the depths of despair to footballing nirvana, landing a historic domestic treble in the League of Ireland. It would culminate with the arrival of football royalty with Sven-Goran Eriksson bringing his Benfica team of superstars into the heart of the Bogside for a European Cup tie."

Londoner Page will be looking to extend his winning streak to six fights in his home city against the only fighter to defeat him in his professional career so far. Page, widely regarded as the poster boy for British MMA, has won 19 of his 20 professional fights with the only blemish on his record coming against Lima at Bellator 221 in May 2019. Since then Page has shown imperious form winning five straight fights but his opponent Lima will be looking to cause an upset for the hometown faithful and earn himself an immediate shot at recapturing the welterweight title which he lost to Yaroslav Amosov via unanimous decision in June of this year.The co-main event sees Northern Ireland’s Leah McCourt take on American Jessica Borga. McCourt “The Curse” is undefeated in her four previous fights in the Bellator cage including an epic come-from-behind victory against Janay Harding during her last outing at Bellator 259 in May. Now sitting at No. 5 in Bellator’s featherweight rankings a win over Borga would take her a step closer to a world title fight with reigning women’s featherweight champion Cris Cyborg. Borga meanwhile will be looking to build on a promising start to her Bellator career. Most recently, “The Black Widow” went 15 minutes with former title challenger Talita Nogueira, following up an impressive submission triumph over Amber Leibrock in her promotional debut. Elsewhere on the main card, Scottish fighter Robert Whiteford takes on Sunderland’s Andrew Fisher in what promises to be a thrilling featherweight contest. MMA veteran Whiteford boasts a hugely impressive professional record of 16 wins in his 20 career fights and is making his return to the cage for the first time since 2019 where he defeated Sam Sicilia in front of a packed crowd at Bellator’s previous visit to London. Fisher will be looking to follow up his unanimous decision win on his promotional debut against Ashleigh Grimshaw in Milan last October.On an evening filled with high class action, Englishman Luke Trainer will be looking to keep his undefeated professional record going when he takes on countryman Yannick Bahati in a light heavyweight bout Welsh welterweight Lewis Long bids for his 19th professional win against Slovenian Uros Jurisic and home favourites Tim Wilde and Kane Mousah both face challenges against French opponents Yves Landu and Davy Gallon.

Bridget Riley has been challenging our perception through painting for over 60 years, with radical work that has transformed how we look at art and invites us to feel with our eyes. With simple black and white geometric shapes, repeated curves of colour or an array of muted dots, Riley’s work moves, shimmers and - in some cases - unsettles. At the age of 90, Bridget Riley shows no signs of stopping. Her paintings command millions at auction, she has won prestigious awards and honours, and continues to innovate, paint, publish and exhibit around the world. BBC cameras have filmed with Riley over the past few years in two of her studios, on the cliffs of Cornwall, where she spent the Second World War, and at the National Gallery in London during the installation of her enormous mural there in 2018. In a rare and revealing interview with Kirsty Wark, Riley dispels the numerous misconceptions which have followed her throughout her career. Many consider her as a poster girl for the Swinging 60s, while others hail her as a titan of abstract art. However, Riley considers herself a traditional painter who has merely picked up the baton from those who have gone before her, such as Leonardo da Vinci, Monet, Cezanne and Matisse."

As reports of sexual violence have dramatically increased in recent years, the government has urged US colleges to enforce a stricter code of sexual conduct amongst students. Employing specialist administrators to carry out investigations into alleged misdemeanors, they now have the power to permanently exclude those they deem ‘responsible’. For the victims of sexual assault these new processes, which require less stringent levels of proof than criminal cases, have allowed accusations that might have never been heard in a court of law to be vindicated.  But alleged perpetrators believe the attempt to be more vigilant about rape and assault has turned into an overreaction that tramples on due process, and harms innocent people. At the start of this journey, Louis meets a neuroscience major called Saif Khan, who has been accused of raping a fellow student. His university is investigating the claims separately even though Saif has been found not-guilty in a court of law. Though Saif continuously pleads his innocence, Louis is drawn into an increasingly complex world, where separating fact from fiction becomes increasingly challenging. He also meets young women whose claims of sexual assault have previously fallen on deaf ears, who believe that a new approach to handling allegations of sex crimes is not only necessary but long overdue. One such student is Mollie Johnson, whose experience is a powerful reminder that there is now a broader understanding of what sexual assault looks like."

As a presenter on CBeebies, Cerrie was astonished to learn that some viewers thought her appearance would scare watching children. Now, she wants to find out where these attitudes to disabled people come from and why they persist today.She discovers how our modern attitudes to disabled people were first formed in the workhouses of Victorian Britain, uncovers the original records of an institution created to segregate disabled people and stop them having children, and traces the hidden lives of those confined to institutions for their whole lives.Cerrie hears astonishing stories of heartbreak and cruelty. But she also meets some pioneers who changed the lives of disabled people forever. John Evans was one of the very first to move from a residential home into a one of his own, and Alia Hassan brought the streets of London to a standstill as part of a campaign fighting for disabled people to be allowed to get on a bus.Ultimately Cerrie discovers that although much has changed for disabled people in Britain today, the battle is not yet won.Silenced is a story of huge social change that many of us still don’t know about, told through the hidden lives of disabled people."

Each one - from the song of the largest lemur to the song of the humpback whale to the song of the lyrebird - was recorded in his lifetime.When Sir David was born, the science of song had already been transformed by Charles Darwin’s theory of sexual selection: singing is dangerous as it reveals the singer’s location to predators, but it also offers the male a huge reward, the chance to attract a female and pass on genes to the next generation. Hence males sing and females don't. Today, new science in the field of birdsong is transforming those long-held ideas. Scientists are discovering that, in fact, in the majority of all songbird species, females sing - and it is only now they are being properly heard. Through this revelation and others, we can understand that animal songs are marvelous examples of the spectacular survival strategies that species have developed in order to stay alive."

It’s an exciting milestone for them both, but for some disabled young adults like Harvey it also brings a daunting uncertainty as the people and places that have cared for him as a child are about to change. Now Harvey and Katie must navigate this transition together, and Katie has some tough decisions to make on Harvey's behalf - such as where he will live and what his future will look like - and in doing so she must also learn to let go.        Harvey was born with septic optic dysplasia, a rare disorder that affects brain function, hormones and vision, and affects one in 10,000 births. He has a long list of medical and behavioural conditions, and his future is unpredictable. As he moves into adulthood, it marks a transition into unchartered territory as there are no other adults known to have Harvey’s combination of conditions.    As Harvey and Katie explore the options of further education colleges and meet other families with disabled young adults, he reconnects with an old friend whose been through his transition year and is now flourishing in college, and whose mum gives Katie some sound advice. Katie is forced to face what could be at stake if she makes the wrong decision, meeting Isabelle, whose autistic son Matthew was sectioned at 15 years old. Katie discovers that there are over 2,000 people with autism or learning disabilities currently kept against their will in assessment and treatment units.      Harvey and Katie open up their lives, sharing their personal highs and lows at a crucial time of change. We get to know Harvey, and through him and his relationship with his mum, we get to know a very different Katie to the one so often seen in the tabloids – as a mum dealing with issues that so many parents of disabled children and young adults face."

Changing Landscapes,Science & Nature,"BBC, iPlayer, TV, Changing Landscapes",Meditating on the care and carelessness weve brought to bear on Scotlands environment.,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p0b1vwn4.jpg,58 mins,3497,10:35pm 2 Nov 2021,Meditating on the care and carelessness we've brought to bear on Scotland's environment.,Changing Landscapes meditates upon the care and carelessness humans brought to bear on the environment in Scotland. Rare archive combines with performances from the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra.,"Scotland has always been intensely proud of its landscape. But at the same time, Scotland has always done its natural world grave harm. As the Cop26 conference on climate change approaches in Glasgow, BBC Scotland’s Changing Landscapes meditates upon the care and carelessness we’ve brought to bear on the environment. In this 60-minute film, Scotland’s film and video archives from the last 100 years illustrate the story of this contradiction. The words of poets, ecologists, journalists and travellers - read by some of Scotland’s most famous voices - are combined with the voices of ordinary folk from our archival store people whose relationship with land and nature is as varied as folk always are. It is their workplace, the place where they take their leisure, the place where they go to shoot the carefully curated stocks of deer and grouse. We see how very deep we have mined and drilled in search of coal and oil – and how far we have hiked and biked in search of solitude and beauty. We learn that the damage done has always been at the back of our minds, at the very least since the 1930s. Driving the film is BBC Scotland’s Scottish Symphony Orchestra performing a carefully selected soundtrack of work by Scottish composers old and new, featuring pieces by one of Scotland’s oldest living composers, Thea Musgrave, and one of its youngest, Jay Capperauld. We hear from some of the finest of Scotland’s folk musicians, Julie Fowlis and Kris Drever, who remind us that Scotland’s relationship with nature has been in many ways like a bad romance. Our narrators read passages from a wide range of sources. We hear words from Scotland’s newly appointed makar, Kathleen Jamie, and passages from poets such as Edwin Muir, Liz Lochhead, Edwin Morgan, Magi Gibson, Don Paterson and Robert Burns – evocations of Scotland’s landscapes, both rural and urban. We also hear from travel writers and journalists, old biographies of Osgood Mackenzie and excerpts of the ecologist Fraser Darling’s 1930s report on the Scottish Highlands: ‘they are a wet desert'. Readings from newspapers, accounts of mining, environmental protests, good summers, hard winters, trespassing ramblers seeking the right to roam. And growing towns. Changing Landscapes, sometimes abstract in places, evokes a Scotland – and a planet - which may be on the brink of environmental collapse."

Featuring fans including Levison Wood and Ade Adepitan as they reflect on his achievement.,"This special episode sees Michael revisit his fifth travel series – Himalaya.For Michael, this epic journey across the world’s highest mountain range is the fulfilment of boyhood dreams inspired by the 1953 ascent of Everest by Hillary and Tensing. Beginning in the famous Khyber Pass, he travels through Pakistan and India and ascends into Nepal and Tibet to reach Everest base camp itself, before venturing into the mountain kingdom of Bhutan.But Michael’s journey isn’t all about scaling peaks – it’s also about finding out what life is like for the people who live in some of the harshest environments on Earth. He is curious to see countries that were cut off by the mountains for centuries and that have developed their own distinct cultures and ways of survival, to discover the different ways that religion influences society here, and to meet the hardy inhabitants of the mountains.Along the way, Michael sees Pakistan’s historically volatile North West Frontier region and narrowly avoids a bull during a bull-racing festival. Crossing the border into India, he visits the Sikh city of Amritsar and the Golden Temple, where he learns about Sikhism and eats with the thousands of pilgrims who come there. And in Dharamshala, he learns about Buddhism and meets the Dalai Lama – who turns out to be a Palin fan.Moving ever upwards into the mountains, Michael suffers from altitude sickness, and at one point thinks he might have to give up. But he recovers and is rewarded with stunning views of the Annapurna range. Eventually, he reaches Everest base camp, where he reflects on the achievement of walking in the footsteps not only of Hillary but of the earlier British explorers Mallory and Irvine, who were childhood heroes of his.Being curious to find out how people live up at high altitude, he spends time with a Nepalese yak-herder and his family, making a real connection despite not speaking their language. In Nagaland, he has a chat with an elderly headhunter, who turns out to be much friendlier than he looks. Finally, Michael journeys through the isolated and magical nation of Bhutan, before descending to sea-level in Bangladesh."

Christmas means a busy time for elves. Jiffy, the Big Boss Elf, is on the search for Dillydally, the Delivery Elf, but he’s late, and Jiffy needs him back so they can double-check that everyone’s got everything they need for another perfect Christmas in Storyland.In order to check that everyone has received their Christmas deliveries, Jiffy and Dillydally sing ‘Stocking Up Your Stocking’. But oh dear, Dillydally has forgotten to deliver Christmas to the Empress of Storyland. In a panic, Jiffy loads up Dillydally’s giant stocking with everything the Empress has ordered: lights, snow, a tree and Christmas crackers. Jiffy sends Dillydally off to make his urgent Christmas delivery with a reminder to be ‘Quick Quick, Quickety Quick’.Dillydally soon learns that the journey to the Empress’s palace will not go quite as he planned. Taking a short cut past the School under the Ocean, Dillydally meets a host of musical sea creatures, including a saxophone-playing Manta Ray, and joins them for a quick boogie. Soon the pupils are frozen in their tracks by their teacher, Professor Lobster. Jelly Jellyfish warns Dillydally to watch out - Professor Lobster can get a bit crabby sometimes! Dillydally learns that the pupils would love a Christmas disco and they even hope it will give their teacher a well-earned break.Professor Lobster reminds the class they have a bit of catching up to do this year, and they can’t have a Christmas disco without lights. Dillydally realises he’s got something stocked in his stocking that might help: Christmas Lights! The band strike up and Jelly Jellyfish sings ‘Christmas Lights’. Jiffy arrives and reminds Dillydally he shouldn’t be dilly-dallying as he’s got a Christmas delivery to make to the Empress of Storyland.Further along the way, Dillydally is interrupted by the sounds of trumpets coming from the Castles on Clouds. Up in the clouds, Dillydally meets a Prince and Princess who are trying to deliver a Christmas cake to their Grand Old Gramps the King and Grand Old Gran the Queen, who live far away on a neighbouring cloud. The Princess eagerly shows off her new invention: The Cake-a-Pulter. When the Princess and Grand Old Gramps sing ‘Wish You Were Here’, Dillydally learns that the Prince and Princess have tried all sorts of ways to deliver a Christmas cake to their grandparents. Wishing he could help them, Dillydally realises his stocking is stocked up with stuff to help. The helpful elf pulls out the Christmas tree and makes a bridge between the two clouds.Sent on his way again by Jiffy, Dillydally is determined he will dilly-dally no more but reaching the top of a rainbow, he comes to a halt at a stop sign. Up ahead, two Space Protectors are hard at work looking after the planets and making the stars shine. Dillydally watches on as the Space Protectors do a funny dance trying to help the stars twinkle again, but nothing seems to be working. The helpful elf suggests that maybe the stars aren’t twinkling because they’re sad, and once again Dillydally thinks he may have something stocked in his stocking that can help – Christmas crackers!Getting closer to the Empress of Storyland’s palace, Dillydally hears something coming from the top of the misty mountains and decides one last stop can’t hurt. At the top of the mountain, Dillydally meets a yodelling Yeti and learns how to say Happy Christmas in Yeti all thanks to Yeti’s song called ‘Yeti Yodel Hoo’. After the song, Dillydally finds out that Yeti is missing his snow friends. Dillydally knows he can use the last thing he’s got left in his stocking to help, but he really needs to deliver the snow to the Empress of Storyland. In a flurry of snow, Yeti’s friends Icicle and Snowflake reappear and everyone enjoys singing together once more. But Dillydally has still got an important job to do, and there is no time to lose, so Jiffy takes the elf to the palace herself.At the palace, Jiffy finally discovers that there is nothing left in Dillydally’s stocking to deliver to the Empress. In a panic, Jiffy suggests that they use their magic elf hats to tinkle their way out of the tricky situation, but it’s too late. The elves fear the worst as the Empress asks, 'Where’s my Christmas?' But brave Dillydally tells the Empress the story of where all her Christmas delivery has ended up. The Empress declares that Dillydally has delivered a story of the happiest Christmas in Storyland: he’s delivered, fun, friendship and kindness. As the Empress sings 'Stocking Up Your Stocking with Love’, everyone in Storyland comes together to celebrate.At the end of the song, a little girl tucks her toy yeti and lobster into bed, tells her gran she loves her and with a final ‘yeti yodel’ falls asleep ready for Christmas Day."

Witness interviews show the horror of the day and expose the failures of the police and press in the wake of the tragedy.,"Hillsborough is an in-depth, moving account of Britain's worst sporting disaster, in which 96 men, women and children were killed, hundreds injured and thousands traumatised. Beginning with that fateful day, 15 April 1989, the film details the horror of the tragedy, told through the experiences of those directly involved: fans, survivors, family members and police officers. Many speak publicly for the first time.It captures the horror of the crush on the terraces, revealing the prejudices held by the police towards football fans. It exposes the police commanders' abject failure in leadership as the tragedy unfolded, and their deceit and determination to deflect responsibility for their failures in crowd management onto those who survived. The documentary exposes the lack of dignity shown to bereaved families as they arrived in Sheffield to identify their loved ones laid out in body bags on a gymnasium floor. It considers the impact of the orchestrated vilification of fans in the media and, as a consequence, their public condemnation.

Everything in the natural world is connected in networks that support the whole of life on earth, including us, and we are losing many of the benefits that nature provides to us. The loss of insects is threatening the pollination of crops, while the loss of biodiversity in the soil also threatens plants growth. Plants underpin many of the things that we need, and yet one in four is now threatened with extinction.   Last year, a UN report identified the key drivers of biodiversity loss, including overfishing, climate change and pollution. But the single biggest driver of biodiversity loss is the destruction of natural habitats.   Seventy-five per cent of Earth's land surface (where not covered by ice) has been changed by humans, much of it for agriculture, and as consumers we may unwittingly be contributing towards the loss of species through what we buy in the supermarket. Our destructive relationship with the natural world isn’t just putting the ecosystems that we rely on at risk. Human activities like the trade in animals and the destruction of habitats drive the emergence of diseases.   Disease ecologists believe that if we continue on this pathway, this year’s pandemic will not be a one-off event."

He digs deep into Joe's background, meets Carole Baskin and asks what made the Tiger King.","This 90-minute special sees Louis Theroux travel to America to investigate the story of a man who has become one of the most controversial and captivating icons of recent times: the gun-toting, self-described 'gay hillbilly' and 'Tiger King' Joe Exotic.A decade on from when he first met Joe for the documentary America’s Most Dangerous Pets, Louis returns to Oklahoma, responding to a direct call from Joe to tell the ‘real story’ and to explore the saga of an animal hoarder turned convicted felon. Joe now resides in a federal prison, having been found guilty of a murder-for-hire plot and multiple animal cruelty charges. But rather than living as a pariah, Joe is now a media phenomenon, the object of international obsession for pundits, celebrities and viewers, with a well-funded campaign team attempting to win him a presidential pardon.  Looking back at his original documentary, Louis reflects on hours of unseen footage and sets out to understand who the real Joe Exotic is and how he used his considerable charm and wiles to assemble a vast menagerie of animals and humans, all roped into a grand project of vanity and deception. Meeting old friends and family members of Joe’s, Louis picks apart the true crime story of how Joe came to be convicted. He also tells the story of Joe’s captivating charisma and the way in which it became a key ingredient in a viral television sensation, with life-changing consequences for all those involved - most of all Carole Baskin, originally the object of Joe’s vitriol, who found herself the target of his murder-for-hire plot and a mass trolling campaign. He digs deep into Joe’s family, unearthing the origin story of Joe’s pathology and laying bare an only-in-America saga that is part crime story, part media spectacle, part animal rights campaign but ultimately a 21st-century fable of a cowboy-cum-cult leader whose very fragility became a source of power - a power which, in some respects, persists to this day."

This documentary tells the story of this horrific attack and events surrounding it through the testimony of those closest to it - including Jo Cox's family, eye witnesses and those who knew the murderer, Thomas Mair.With unique access to West Yorkshire Police's murder investigation, the film draws together CCTV, archive footage and other evidence that was gathered by the investigating officers. The result is a forensic exploration of a horrific murder. What led a man with no history of violence to brutally murder a female MP whom he had never met?Jo Cox's political convictions and the issues she fought so passionately for were at odds with Mair's viewpoint, which some think motivated him to murder. Who Jo Cox was and what she stood for is explored in the film through archive footage and intimate interviews with family and friends. Thomas Mair's activities in the days leading up to the attack are retraced through interviews with detectives working on the case. Along with the testimony of those who knew Mair, they portray a complex and contradictory character, a man who volunteered to help people of all races yet harboured a secret obsession with Nazism and the extreme right."

Can he now, in mid-life, tackle what he failed to learn the first time round?He’s not alone in facing this issue. Research findings suggest that a quarter of all children in England leave primary school, like Blades, unable to read to the expected level. More than eight million adults in the UK have poor literacy skills, and half of all prisoners either can’t read or struggle to do so.Using a system developed for use in prisons by the Shannon Trust, Jay commits to learn to read with Read Easy, a charity whose volunteers do one-to-one coaching. Along the way, he revisits key moments in his life that were shaped by not being able to read: the ‘learner’ class at school, the dead-end jobs he had to take because he had no qualifications, and not being able to read his children bedtime stories. Daughter Zola is now 15, and Jay wants to read her a story before she reaches adulthood on her next birthday.Following Jay over six months of learning, this intimate and revealing film goes behind closed doors to see how he organizes his upholstery business without the written word, manages on The Repair Shop without scripts and struggles each day with his vowels and consonants as he tries to learn phonics. We meet Jay’s girlfriend Lisa, his daughter Zola and his ‘adopted’ family who all help him with his reading challenge. Jay also meets school pupils and adults who struggle with reading and writing, as he discovers the human stories behind the nation’s literacy statistics."

Between August and November, five horrifically violent murders took place in Whitechapel.  There was a huge manhunt, but the Ripper was never caught. Since then there has been endless speculation about who the Ripper was, what motivated his crimes, and how the killer escaped justice. Presented by the star of BBC One drama Silent Witness Emilia Fox and Britain’s top criminologist Professor David Wilson, this documentary casts new light on the Jack the Ripper case. Together Emilia and David look at the Ripper’s modus operandi using modern technology - like a digital autopsy table - and recreating the murder sites to help understand the extraordinary risks the Ripper took to kill his victims.  Also, using the Home Office Large Major Enquiry System (HOLMES), a bespoke computer system used by the police to help detect patterns in criminal activity, and evidence uncovered within the investigation, results strongly indicate that Martha Tabram was in fact the first Ripper victim.  Convinced that Martha Tabram was the Ripper’s first victim, Emilia and David ask a geographical profiling expert to take a fresh look at the pattern of Ripper murder sites, which takes the investigation in a completely different direction, ultimately identifying the most likely suspect.   The debate about Jack the Ripper’s true identity is already over 130 years old and is sure to continue, but this documentary casts new light onto the case and is as definitive as could be in naming the killer."

With extraordinary access to the contents of a smartphone used by three British men who left their homes to go to Syria and fight with ISIS, journalist Mobeen Azhar uncovers what happened to the three men. Mobeen tries to understand their motivations, how they became radicalised and who is ultimately responsible for their one-way journey to certain death. Using previously unseen videos, photos and screenshots from the smartphone, Mobeen explores what made these three men join an estimated 900 Britons who went out to Syria and Iraq to fight with the world’s most feared terrorist group. While much of the media’s focus has been on the schoolgirls who went to join ISIS, a much larger number of the Britons who made this journey were young men. The three men who feature on the smartphone came from very different backgrounds, and one was a private school boy. Reaching out to the people who really knew them, Mobeen pieces together their stories of hope and delusion - a case study in how extremist ideology takes hold of a life."

In this programme, he sets out to understand why his life has been so badly blighted by gambling and explores the relationship between football and gambling at a time when it has never been more urgent to question the industry’s place in the world of sport.Now on the path to recovery, he wants to understand what caused his addiction. Could it be the way his brain is wired, his environment or both? Paul sets out to meet old teammates, scientists and psychologists to see if he can get close to finding the answer. He starts by meeting former Arsenal teammate Wes Reid. When they received their first pay cheques as Arsenal trainees, Paul and Wes went to the bookies, and Paul lost his entire week’s wages in 15 minutes, kicking off a 35-year struggle with gambling. Paul also meets footballers Keith Gillespie, John Hartson and Scott Davies, who between them gambled away £15 million, and he visits the families of three men who took their own lives as a result of gambling addiction. At Imperial College London, he talks to Dr David Erritzoe, a consultant psychiatrist whose team of researchers are mapping the brain, trying to pinpoint the neurobiological basis of gambling addiction so that new treatments can be developed. As the government considers whether gambling laws should be reformed to protect those addicted to gambling, Paul wonders if an entire generation of young Brits is at risk of following the same dangerous path that he trod.

Following on from CBeebies A Midsummer Night's Dream, Steven Kynman is back as William Shakespeare, this time with backstage help from Swashbuckle's Captain Captain. Andy Day takes on the fantastical Shakespearean role of the island monster Caliban, while Justin Fletcher is the king's comical jester, Trinculo. With Patrick Robinson as Prospero and Annette Badland as his good friend Gonzala, CBeebies The Tempest brings together an amazing cast to perform one of Shakespeare's best-loved plays. Set on an island not far from Italy, the play tells the story of Prospero, one-time Duke of Milan, who lives with his daughter Miranda, their monster servant Caliban and a magical, musical and mostly invisible sprite called Ariel. Having been sent away from Milan 12 years earlier by his own brother Sebastian and King Alonso, Prospero has spent his time on the island practising his magic, studying and plotting for a time when he can take revenge. That moment has arrived. All his enemies are aboard a ship sailing near the island and it is the perfect time for Prospero's plan.Creating a magical storm with his sprite Ariel, Prospero causes a shipwreck, landing the king and his lords, ladies, butler and jester all over the island. Slowly Prospero weaves his magic to fulfil his plan, with Ariel carrying out many of his tasks, before eventually forgiving all those who did him wrong.Filmed at the Lawrence Batley Theatre, Huddersfield, in front of a live invited audience, CBeebies The Tempest is the perfect introduction to Shakespeare for families and preschoolers, with the most famous moments from Shakespeare's original text surrounded by magic, music and mischief."

David Olusoga exposes the secret files behind the Windrush scandal.,"David Olusoga opens secret government files to show how the Windrush scandal and the ‘hostile environment’ for black British immigrants has been 70 years in the making. The film features Sarah O’Connor, Anthony Bryan and Judy Griffith. Settled here legally since childhood, they were re-classified as illegal immigrants by new ‘hostile environment’ regulations. Unable to show proof of their nationality status, they lost jobs, savings and their health, facing deportation back to countries they could barely remember. David reveals how today’s scandal is rooted in the secrets of the past. The first Windrush generation were Commonwealth citizens - many of them ex-servicemen - coming to rebuild war-torn Britain. Yet even before arriving, they were viewed by the government with hostility. Civil servants and MPs warned of dire consequences if what they called a ‘coloured element’ was introduced into the UK. PM Clement Attlee even suggested diverting the Windrush passengers to east Africa - to pick peanuts. The same government was actively recruiting tens of thousands of white volunteer workers from Europe - some of them former members of Waffen-SS regiments which stood accused of war crimes on the Eastern Front - for ‘permanent settlement here with a view to their inter-marrying and complete absorption into our own working population’. The files expose how successive British governments spent the next decade trying to devise a way to prevent further Caribbean arrivals without appearing to discriminate against them. PM Winston Churchill, dissatisfied with ministers’ response to what he saw as a serious problem, kept the issue on the cabinet agenda and a special Working Party was set up to gather information to make the political case for immigration controls. Two weeks after the Queen’s coronation as head of the UK and Commonwealth, a secret race survey was undertaken and completed, looking for proof that Commonwealth immigrants were a burden on the welfare state. Chief constables in major cities were asked if ‘the coloured community as a whole, or particular sections of it, are generally idle or poor workmen’, and if they were ‘addicted to drug-trafficking or other types of crime’. The Working Party found no evidence for the view that the ‘coloured community’ was less law-abiding or hard working than other Brits.  When Harold Macmillan’s government introduced the 1962 Immigration Act, its control mechanism was the employment prospects of would-be immigrants. The files show how home secretary ‘Rab’ Butler, described the ‘great merit’ of the scheme was that it ‘can be presented as making no distinction on grounds of race or colour’, but would, in practice, ‘operate on coloured people almost exclusively’. By that time, Caribbean immigration had shrunk to a fraction of earlier levels. But, fearing further restrictions, the Windrush generation now arranged for their children to come. The ‘children of the Windrush' had full legal rights to join their parents in the UK, and many arrived with little paperwork or official record keeping.  Successive governments passed new immigration and nationality legislation, often in response to perceived ‘problems’ or ‘crises’. Harold Wilson rushed through the 1968 Immigration Act, in just three days to stop arrivals of thousands of passport-holding British-Indians living in Kenya, whose businesses and livelihoods were threatened by its government. Edward Heath’s 1971 Act tried to restrict the legal definition of ‘Britishness’. It also placed the burden of proof on the claimant should their Britishness be challenged - a fateful clause for the ‘children of the Windrush’.  Throughout the multiple changes to immigration and nationality law enacted up to 2014, the nationality status of the ‘children of Windrush’ remained unchanged and unchallenged. As British citizens with full legal rights to live here, they put down roots, pursued careers, raised children and grandchildren and contributed in ways great and small to the creation of modern Britain. But with the introduction of the so-called ‘hostile environment’ legislation of 2014 and 2016, their situation changed. Though they were never the intended targets of the new laws, the hostile environment machine that evolved over the decade wasn’t designed to make allowances. Suddenly required to prove their status (due to the 1971 Act), Sarah, Anthony and Judy found themselves unable to show the levels of proof demanded by the new ‘hostile environment’ regulations. All three lost their jobs for up to two years and ran up debt trying to make ends meet. Anthony was arrested twice by Immigration Officers and held for weeks in detention centres. Then a ticket was bought to deport him to Jamaica, a country hadn’t seen since he left, aged eight, in 1965. ‘They broke me in there,’ Anthony says. ‘It was hard.’ Judy Griffith, still struggling to repay her debts, says: ‘It makes you question the whole, what is British? What is Britishness?’"

The assault left her with many unanswered questions. Why did it happen? Why did he think he could do it? And where did he learn that? Speaking to her friends, it quickly became clear that they all had their own stories - and many believe the problem starts at school.In spring 2021, the website Everyone’s Invited was flooded with thousands of anonymous testimonies from schoolgirls sharing stories of sexual assault and harassment. An emergency Ofsted report confirmed that rape culture has been raging unchecked in our schools, and that urgent action is needed to tackle it. In this timely documentary, Zara speaks to young women and girls about their experience of rape culture. Exploring both state and private schools, Zara speaks to pupils to understand first-hand how these toxic behaviours happen.Zara also meets young women who have been assaulted or raped by pupils at their school, finding out what action was taken by their schools while their cases were underway. One ex-pupil's perpetrator was allowed to remain in school alongside her during the trial and after his sentence was served. Another pupil tells Zara that she is too ashamed to tell her school and parents about her assault, fearing that no-one will believe her. And finally, Zara meets the friends and family of 12-year-old Semina Halliwell, who alleged she was raped by a boy from her school. She took her own life in June 2021. Her mum, Rachel, speaks about the devastation at the loss of her daughter and the rape culture on social media that she blames for Semina's tragic death."

Specially for this documentary, he has been filmed creating an extraordinary new work: a canvas 30 feet long and seven feet high, on which self-portraits and classic characters emerge in the instantly recognisable, energetic and ebullient style that has taken root in the imaginations of successive generations of children and parents.  Quentin Blake turns 89 in December 2021. His first book was published 61 years ago, and over 500 volumes later, he is still hard at work, drawing every day and determined to break down the barriers between illustration and ‘fine arts’. As he looks back for the first documentary to be dedicated to his life, Blake shares his pleasure in the blank page, the scratch of a quill, and the enjoyable mischief and chaos of childhood. Some of his closest collaborators and biggest admirers pay tribute – among them David Walliams, Michael Rosen, Lauren Child, Chris Riddell, Steven Appleby, Dapo Adeola, Josie Long and Emma Chichester Clark.  There are also readings of works Blake has illustrated, performed by Joanna Lumley, Peter Capaldi and Ore Oduba."

Written by multiple Bafta winner Jack Thorne and actor-turned-writer Genevieve Barr, Then Barbara Met Alan stars Bafta-nominated Ruth Madeley (Don’t Take My Baby, Years and Years) as comedian and activist Barbara Lisicki, and Arthur Hughes (Help, The Innocents) as singer-songwriter and activist Alan Holdsworth. Their story begins in the early 1990s, when many disabled people in Britain faced huge barriers in the workplace, lived in poor quality housing and could not even get on inaccessible public transport. At that time, the idea that the disabled community should be the grateful beneficiaries of charity handouts was commonplace, and far from being equal independent citizens, disabled people had no rights in law.  With their wicked sense of humour and post-punk energy combined, the pair soon decide to take down Telethon, a 28-hour TV charity event that raises funds by pulling on heart strings and wrongly making people feel sorry for disabled people. For the first time in history, they galvanise an army of disabled protestors from across Britain, united under an incendiary 'Piss on Pity' protest slogan, and soon Telethon is no more.  Having shocked a nation and shown what disabled people are capable of, they form DAN, the disabled people's Direct Action Network. Soon they head out on tour, with their new baby in tow, to shut down inaccessible bus routes and spontaneously picket cinemas, restaurants and train stations – anywhere that denies access to disabled people.   Finally, having honed their use of pink handcuffs as part of their direct-action tactics and after suffering the loss of DAN members along the way, Barbara and Alan embark on a fearless and coordinated plan to bring Westminster to a standstill until the establishment can no longer stand in their way and disabled people are granted equal rights in law. This punky and irreverent film is directed by Bafta-winning Bruce Goodison (Anne, Murdered By My Father) and Bafta-nominated Amit Sharma (Crip Tales), with music by Chaz Jankel (The Blockheads) and Alan Holdsworth. At its heart, this is an uplifting and irreverent love story of two extraordinary people, destined to change the world from the moment they set eyes on each other. Through their humour and unstoppable energy, disabled people find a voice and begin a journey towards gaining the rights they have long deserved. But as Barbara and Alan devote their lives to the cause, campaign success comes at a personal cost, and the pair are eventually driven apart on the eve of their historic, yet bittersweet, victory."

In 2014, 22-year-old Elliot Rodger shot and stabbed six of his fellow students to death in a premeditated attack at the University of California, Santa Barbara. His motive? In a chilling video Rodger said he was angry that he was still a virgin and in his words wanted to show himself as 'the true alpha male' by punishing women for not being attracted to him. The legacy of Rodger's assault catapulted online incels into wider consciousness. Incels - short for 'involuntary celibates' - are a global community of sexually frustrated young men, who have found support amongst one another on the net. Some idolise Rodger, and chillingly, his murder spree seems to have helped inspire at least three further mass killings in North America, that have mainly targeted women.   At its extreme, incel ideology spreads violent misogyny, which blames women for depriving men of sex and relationships. Some forums have recorded up to 40,000 members and feature depraved ideas like state-sponsored rape and girlfriends.  Following eight months of unprecedented access to incels, this documentary is the deepest exploration yet of this notoriously closed community.  Told primarily through the personal stories of three men who identify as incels, the documentary explores how an online ideology can push young men into very disturbing behaviour. But the film also delves behind the sensationalist media headlines to unearth some of the reasons for incels' existence - many feel alienated and are enduring difficulties, like mental health issues, autism or traumatic upbringing.  For some, the online forums are a haven to joke, vent and find support in a world where they are struggling to find an identity and where gender relations are changing dramatically. The question is, where are the lines between this radical misogyny and violence?"

Britain boldly presents itself as a beacon of racial tolerance, but with demonstrations sweeping the country, organisers believe that they are closer than ever to changing the way British institutions and individuals treat black people across the UK. There have been multiple campaigns for equality and justice for black British communities in the past, but none quite like this. The worldwide response to George Floyd’s death has given confidence to a new generation that this time could be different. The people behind the protests in Britain believe that they have the tools, allies, language and technology to create a new reality - but is this country ready to move beyond tolerance, to become an actively anti-racist society? The Windrush scandal, Grenfell and a recent resurgence in far-right terror plots have exposed fault lines across Britain. Now the graphic nature of George Floyd’s death is forcing us all to ask questions about the scale of racism in our communities and to explore what can be done to eliminate it for good. From Premier League football clubs, to superstar actors like John Boyega, the message is loud and uncompromising: Black Lives Matter.

They would catch the train from north London to fish this network of rivers and canals that flow from Hertfordshire into the Thames, and just like when Paul was young, Paul and Bob fish for perch.They start their trip in a quiet and secluded stretch of the Lea. Paul gives Bob a copy of The Compleat Angler by Izaak Walton, a 17th-century fishing guide that was written here in Hertfordshire on the Lea and takes the form of a conversation between a skilled angler and his apprentice. Drawing the obvious comparisons, Bob delves into the book over the course of the trip to see if any of its contents still ring true today. They agree they need to be stealthy on this stretch of river, and in hushed tones they chose a suitable spot and settle in. The whispered conversation turns to their teenage years, and they discuss their memories of school dinners, bands they were in and making friends. Bob has prepared Paul a riverside picnic inspired by his trips here when he was young – jam and banana sandwiches and crisps - bringing them both a Proustian rush of teenage, packed-lunch nostalgia. For this episode, Paul has invited a special guest along to the river – Feargal Sharkey, former lead singer of The Undertones turned angler and river conservationist, who fishes the River Lea regularly. As well as discussing their love of fishing, Paul reveals an amusing connection he has to Feargal, which could have seen his life turn out quite differently.   Bob reveals their home for this trip will be a narrowboat, nestled in a quiet section of the canal, close to where they will fish the next day. Over a drink at the end of the day, Paul shares some teenage photos of him and his friends - Bob finds the 1970s hairstyles particularly unusual.On their second day on the River Lea, they return to one of Paul’s favourite haunts – a weir pool that hasn’t much changed since he used to visit, and still home to roach and dace. As they fish, they compare being a teen in the 70s to now, and how ambitions change over time. Bob reads from The Compleat Angler, choosing a section to reveal his gratitude to Paul.They return to the houseboat that evening, and Bob is cooking another 1970s-inspired dish – corned beef and potato pie, just like Paul’s mum used to make. To their surprise, they find it rather tasty after a day out fishing. To round off the trip, Bob performs a song he has written all about what they got up to during their two days on the Lea."

They head straight for one of the best delis in town to scope out the local cuisine, including the legendary sausage figatelli. Tony, the owner, tells them that there is a holy trinity of ingredients that makes up the basics of Corsican food - meat, cheese and chestnuts. He suggests that the best way for the bikers to understand what makes Corsicans tick is to meet the producers. This gives them a clear mission for their trip across the island, starting with a world-class meat producer. Jacques Abbatucci raises a unique breed of cattle, the vache tigre or tiger-cow, a breed recognisable by its distinctive stripes. His free-range and organic approach results in some of the best meat that the bikers have ever eaten. Their next foray into the island's interior takes them to the high plateau where another producer is raising rare-breed pigs. Again, the animals roam freely, grazing on chestnuts in the autumn. Here the charcuterie leaves them in awe. As they lunch with the producer, they also taste a cake made with chestnut flour, another part of the trinity of Corsican flavours. As they travel, they pass through vast forests of chestnut trees and begin to understand the importance of chestnut flour in local cuisine.Much of what is produced in Corsica is exported. Next, the bikers head to the coast where the entrepreneurial spirit has been alive and well for thousands of years. At the Etang de Diane, a salt-water inlet, the bikers discover that mussels and oysters have been grown in these nutrient-rich waters since Roman times. In fact, the Romans shucked and exported so many oysters that the left over shells have created a whole island! And so, to the final element in the trinity of Corsican foods - cheese.At a goat farm in the hills, the bikers meet Karin, a young woman who has taken over the family cheese business and produces cottage cheese alongside the local speciality - brocciu. They cook and eat in her outdoor kitchen with spectacular mountain views. As their Corsican exploration draws to its end, the bikers spend their final night in a mountaintop B&B where the family has spent years restoring abandoned houses in a bid to bring young people back to the more remote parts of Corsica. They learn that the independent spirit of Corsica is alive and well here in the hills and spend a magical evening soaking up the true essence of this unique island.Featured recipes include veal and olive stew, stuffed mussels with courgette gratin and storzapretti (swiss chard and cheese quenelles) with figatelli sausage."

Will the finished build live up to the hopes of the family who live there?,"Imagine stepping inside your home, but suddenly it has transformed beyond your wildest dreams, without ever opening a can of paint or lifting a single brick. Angela Scanlon presents a property makeover series like no other. Cutting-edge virtual reality and visual effects enable people to see what the future of their home could look like, before building it in reality.Never have plans come to life like this - people can instantly explore a stunning transformation of their bedroom, walk around an incredible double-height kitchen or see how adding a gigantic picture window will turn a dingy lounge into a showstopping sitting room. In each episode, a family is presented with two radically different designs by two extraordinary architects, before deciding which to commission.In 2015 Becky and Cris moved from a small cottage to a four-bed 1960s house in Wiltshire, hoping it would provide desperately needed space for their growing children. A family of keen musicians, they also hoped a large reception room would give them the opportunity to play their instruments together. But three years later the house is awkward and unhomely with dark and uninviting rooms. A poor layout means the four of them live quite separately, and those dreamed of musical get-togethers never happen.Becky and Cris have tried to solve the problems with the house but can’t find a design that works for them and their budget of £45,000.  Desperate to bring the family together, they have handed over control to two competing architects, Laura Jane Clark and Robert Jamison. Laura, who specialises in creatively reimagining residential architecture, goes head to head with Robert, who has a reputation for unconventional and maverick ideas.Each architect interprets the brief in wildly different ways and pitches them to Becky and Cris using virtual reality. Laura has come up with clever way to draw light into dark areas of the house, as well as connecting up the living space, whereas Robert has totally redesigned the ground floor in an unexpected and unorthodox way. Becky and Cris are delighted by both, but how will they make the near impossible decision of which one to go with?As the episode nears its end the final, most important reveal is yet to come - it is time to see what has been built in real life. Angela and the chosen architect arrive at Becky and Cris’s once dark and divided home to the most breath-taking transformation. The real-world reveal manages to rival anything seen in virtual reality whilst achieving the ultimate goal of uniting the family with this life-changing renovation."

All with the socially distanced support of Claudia Winkleman. The first challenge takes us away from the dining table and into the living room as Mary Berry challenges the cooks to make their ultimate burger and chips for a TV dinner. Some of the celebrities keep it classic, opting for a good quality beef burger, oozing with melted cheese, while the others are hoping a vegetarian option or a delicate fish burger will be enough for them to get a Judges' Favourite and a step closer to avoiding the dreaded Eliminator. Day two gets off to a frosty start, as Chris reveals frozen peas as the secret ingredient that the celebrities must make the star of the dish for his Rustle Up challenge. One cook is particularly dis’pea’sed with the ingredient, while the others are excited by an Asian-inspired larder. With everything from curry to scones, the judges have a difficult decision deciding who will go through to next week and who will be cooking again for safety in this week’s Eliminator challenge.   Taking both challenges into consideration, the three judges decide who will be cooking again in this week's Eliminator following one of Angela’s toughest recipes to date. Judged blind, the tiniest of details can be the difference between survival and going home. Making a dough, deep frying and technical piping push the cooks to their limits and result in a shocking blind tasting by the three expert judges."

The centre of our galaxy is home to an invisible monster of unimaginable power – a supermassive black hole named Sagittarius A*. Weighing four million times the mass of the Sun, it’s an object with such an immense gravitational field that nothing can escape – not even light.For decades, black holes existed purely in the minds of theoretical physicists – the idea was so absurd, scientists thought they couldn’t possibly exist in nature. But recent astronomical breakthroughs have confirmed not only that black holes like Sagittarius A* exist, but that these bizarre invisible objects may be the ultimate galactic protagonists.Stunning CGI takes us back to witness the fiery origins of our galaxy’s black hole 13.6 billion years ago, when the early universe was home to colossal blue stars hundreds of times more massive than our sun. These stars lived fast and died young, and when they ran out of fuel, they collapsed under their own enormous mass, crushing down into an object so small and so dense it punched a hole in the fabric of the universe. That is how our galaxy’s black hole was born.The story of Sagittarius A* is a tale of both destruction and creation. Over billions of years, it feasted on nearby gas and stars, and through cataclysmic mergers with other black holes it sent ripples through the fabric of the universe. But Brian reveals that we have recently come to understand how our black hole is also an agent of creation. A breakthrough discovery by Nasa’s Fermi gamma-ray telescope has shown that our black hole once had the power to sculpt the entire galaxy, creating vast bubbles of gas above and below our galaxy that persist to this day. We may even have Sagittarius A* to thank for our own existence.In a mind-bending conclusion, Brian reveals how our modern understanding of black holes is challenging our concepts of reality to the breaking point. He takes us on a trip inside Sagittarius A*, where we discover that the interior of a black hole is not a tomb but a gateway to the end of the universe. And weirder still, in trying to understand the fate of objects that fall into Sagittarius A*, scientists have come to a stunning conclusion: space and time, concepts so foundational to how we experience the world around us, are not as fundamental as we once thought."

But where did this feverish passion for homeland begin? For many romantics, it began in 17th-century Switzerland with the diagnosis of a familiar, all-too-human emotion by the Swiss doctor Johannes Hofer - nostalgia. Hofer believed that it was a lethal malady that was triggered by anything that reminded Swiss soldiers serving abroad of home. In Scotland, Simon looks at the work of Robert Burns, who grew up in Ayrshire in the 1770s. Speaking to singer-songwriter Eddi Reader, who performs A Red, Red Rose, Simon explores how Burns created authentically Scottish poetry and music that could hold its own against the oncoming tide of English culture. Simon then travels to Germany to explore how Napoleon’s invasion of the German lands in the early 1800s also kickstarted a group of German romantics to begin their own ‘campaign of national belonging’ – with dark consequences.In the last section of the film, Simon travels to Poland and Paris to look at how Polish romantic artists and musicians, in particular Frederic Chopin, created a ‘Poland of the imagination’ in their art after Poland had not just been defeated but been completely wiped off the map.When the Nazis invaded Poland once again during the Second World War, Chopin’s music was banned, his statues (and scores) across the country were destroyed, and an extraordinary battle was waged over the relic of his actual heart, and so, visiting the Last Night of the Proms in London to hear our own national anthems, Simon asks some profound questions about the resurgence of populist, nationalist movements across the world."

Jupiter is not only the biggest but also the oldest planet in the solar system. It alone witnessed the birth of the Sun and ever since its immense gravity has shaped the destiny of the other worlds. Soon after its birth, its orbit shifted inwards bringing it ever closer to the sun. As it moved, it created chaos in the the region of space that would become the asteroid belt, ensuring that no planet could form here, only a tiny failed planet Ceres, which remains today.As it continued into the inner solar system, Jupiter used its power to throw raw material needed to form planets into the Sun, stunting the growth of Mars, a planet that might otherwise have grown as large as Earth. Indeed, Jupiter would have obliterated every last rocky world on its journey into the Sun, if a tussle with another giant - Saturn - had not brought it back from the brink. Today Jupiter’s great mass continues to be felt. Its gravity torments its moon Io, creating the most volcanically active body in the solar system.  And through the vice-like grip it exerts over the asteroid belt, Jupiter’s influence extends as far as Earth – where it retains the power to change the course of life on our planet. And where, as Brian reveals, it might even have created the conditions for humanity to inherit the Earth."

Come nightfall, the forests surrounding ancient Italian mountain villages become the hunting grounds for rarely seen wolves whilst deep underground in Slovenia’s caves, and living for up to a hundred years, ‘baby dragons’ or olms can be found lurking in the pitch black. But in this crowded world there is still wilderness. On the far eastern edge of the continent, hidden in the vast forests of Finland, is the perfect place for mother brown bears to raise their youngsters. To the North, on the fringes of the Arctic Circle, the open tundra echoes with the sound of titanic battles as head-banging musk ox bulls fight for the right to breed. Europe’s warm, stable climate and the long warm summer days help trigger the continent’s most spectacular wildlife spectacle. In Hungary, for just a few days in June, millions of giant mayflies emerge from the Tisza River. They all now compete, desperate to find a mate - within just a few hours they will all be dead and the spectacle will be over for another year. Romania’s mighty Danube delta attracts birds from around the globe. Here, great white pelican gather in their thousands but instead of finding their own fish, these bully birds rob their cormorant victims of their hard won catch. Today just 4% of Europe is protected wilderness. Many of Europe’s animals have suffered at the hands of man for thousands of years. However, recently dedicated conservation efforts have thrown a lifeline to a lucky few. Once on the brink of extinction, the Iberian lynx is returning to the hills of Spain. Numbers have increased from under 100 to 700 in a matter of decades. Only by protecting the wilderness that remains, and creating new wild spaces, can a future for Europe’s precious wildlife be ensured."

In this episode, expensive films and cheap flights mean Scotland is swarming with excited tourists.","In the autumn of 1995, two events transformed Scottish tourism - Braveheart was released and the first ever Easyjet flight took off, from Luton to Glasgow.Braveheart sold Scotland around the world, making it synonymous with Mel Gibson’s epic. Meanwhile, low-budget airlines and the deregulation of air travel enabled direct routes from the US to open up. The year following Braveheart's release saw the first Tartan Day parade in New York, and Sean Connery beseeched long-lost Scots to return to their homeland. However, the tourism business itself was changing rapidly, with the emerging internet giving tourists a chance to be a travel critic themselves via TripAdvisor reviews, travel blogs and the like, and Scotland had to play catch up to ensure even the smallest businesses had a website. In 2006, the tourist board renamed itself Visit Scotland, and its focus has increasingly been online marketing – including paying influencers and Instagrammers to come and promote Scotland.The second most popular subject searched for online is genealogy, and Scotland has benefited from a glut of Americans, Australians and South Africans returning to trace their roots. Roots tourism is a huge market, and when people track down their ancestors to a cottage or grave, it often cements a deep and meaningful bond with Scotland and with their ancestors' place in Scottish history.Visitors come in search of ‘the real Scotland’ - the rustic fisherman’s cottage, the folk music in the pub, the empty glen. However, due to the money to be made, everyday life in Scotland is often changed by tourism. Edinburgh has suffered from relentless waves of tourism, and a walk down the Royal Mile shows the capital is in danger of turning into a tartan theme park. But Edinburghers are fighting back, questioning the need for more hotels and fighting for residents' rights.In rural Scotland, the benefits of tourism are also bittersweet, with campaigns to curtail Airbnb and a plea to ensure local communities are not overwhelmed by coach tours and tourism."

Can the team prove it’s an eighteenth-century work by the artist Benjamin West?,"The team head to the beautiful island of Anglesey at the northernmost tip of Wales, where Huw Lewis has a sheep farm. Huw  frequently spends his evenings scouring the internet for art bargains and was trawling through eBay when he came across a small, unattributed oil sketch of Jesus and the apostles at the Last Supper. He immediately sensed it was something special and was amazed when nobody bid against him. He secured it for just £50. He later learned that it had been in the seller’s family for decades, and they had assumed it to be practically worthless. After doing some online research of his own, Huw thought he might have identified the artist as Benjamin West. Born in Pennsylvania, West left America in his twenties and settled in Britain, where he quickly found fame and fortune. By the late eighteenth century, he was one of the most celebrated artists of the day, renowned for the bold storytelling of his history paintings. Perhaps his biggest fan was King George III, who made West his official history painter. Together they aimed to bring about a magnificent new era in British art.   Huw’s picture is an unusual one, as it is a small canvas that appears to be semi-finished. It’s partly painted in oils, but also visible are bold, black lines delineating the figures. After examining the picture closely, Philip is intrigued by it but is also worried by its condition. It appears to have been scrubbed in places, and layers of dirt have built up over the years. There’s also no signature, which, given West was very good at promoting himself and his work, is concerning. But Fiona discovers that Benjamin West was commissioned by King George III to paint two paintings of the Last Supper for chapels at Windsor Castle, and at the Royal Academy of Arts she discovers that one of the preparatory sketches for those paintings hasn’t been seen for a century. Could it be that Huw’s internet bargain is the missing West sketch? Forensic science will be key, as a genuine eighteenth-century picture could reveal some more unusual ingredients, and West was known to experiment with paints. At her laboratory in the Courtauld Institute of Art, Professor Aviva Burnstock examines the picture and reveals some surprising details that the naked eye would never see. But this proves to be one of the team’s most difficult investigations. As well as the worrying condition of the picture, they face a provenance trail that should stretch back more than two hundred years. There’s also the added challenge of doing research in the midst of lockdown. With the odds so stacked against them, can they prove that Huw’s internet bargain is actually a long-lost work fit for a king?"

When old enough, will it safely make the heart-stopping and massive leap of faith, off the cliff edge and into the ocean?   It’s midsummer in Cardigan Bay, and we are taken into the glorious and vocal world of playful and seductive bottlenose dolphins. The Teifi Estuary is full of bird life, but a family of shelducks must stay clear of a fox on the hunt for ducklings. In a rockpool in Fishguard, as one of the largest tides of the year heads out, we join the antics of a little sea creature called a gobi. Remarkably, this home-loving fish can survive out of water… but only for a while. Will the tide return in time? And in Gower, which has one of the largest tidal ranges in the world, oystercatchers show off their bill skills as they forage for seafood on the shoreline."

By 1979, the British security forces believed the IRA had become so security conscious that they were impossible to penetrate. But reporter Jennifer O’Leary reveals how one weakness in the IRA’s internal security was exploited to unlock many of the group’s secrets. She charts how Britain used informers and combined that advantage in secret intelligence with the use of special forces to take onone of the IRA’s deadliest units – a strategy that culminated with the Loughgall ambush, when the SAS killed eight IRA men attacking a police station. The programme shows that the aftermath of the attackonly made the IRA’s informer problem worse."

"Salt, by Selina Thompson",Arts,"BBC, iPlayer, TV, Salt, by Selina Thompson",Artist Selina Thompson recalls her journey by sea to retrace a route of the slave trade.,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p09z0lbj.jpg,46 mins,2733,9pm 24 Oct 2021,Artist Selina Thompson recalls her journey by sea to retrace a route of the slave trade.,"Performance artist Selina Thompson recreates her award-winning and deeply personal monologue about her journey by cargo ship, retracing the route of the transatlantic slave trade.","Performance artist Selina Thompson recreates her award-winning dramatic monologue about a journey she made by cargo ship to retrace the triangular route of the transatlantic slave trade. Poetic and deeply personal, Salt is part testimony, part performance and part excavation of collective memory through archive and music.Throughout the film, Thompson explores her painfully difficult but ultimately redemptive exploration of the Atlantic triangle, and in doing so, takes us on a cathartic pilgrimage through grief, race and identity. Darkly comic in places but also intensely sad, Salt is Thompson’s deeply human response to being both British and a descendant of a people enslaved by the British.Central to Salt is Thompson’s physical performance of her monologue. She plays a character, known simply as The Woman, who pounds great rocks of salt, tells profound stories and makes wry observations. The Woman allows Thompson’s particular journey and personal experience to hold a greater resonance, representing the afterlife of slavery and colonialism. The salt the Woman breaks down into manageable pieces embodies that shared experience – the labour of negotiating racism, the tears, the sweat, the healing. The salt is also of the sea, itself a character in the piece that plays witness to the atrocities of the Middle Passage.Complementing Thompson’s performance is a revealing, unflinchingly honest and at times humorous interview conducted by Afua Hirsch.Thompson describes her journey, reflecting on the feelings and thoughts that defined her experience at the time, as well as her meditations now, five years after the original journey. She is an exceptional storyteller and her candidness, vivid powers of description and facility with language give Salt a raw and powerful intimacy. Recalled in distinct chapters, Thompson’s journey takes her by sea from Belgium to Ghana, on to Jamaica and finally back across the Atlantic to Europe. She set out on this extraordinary journey not to try to experience the horror of the Middle Passage, but to ‘sit with it’, to commemorate the dead. Part way through her journey, that grieving process takes on an additional significance with the death of her beloved grandmother. In exploring the past and its lasting legacy, Thompson is also looking for new definitions of home on the three continents she visits, having been told variously her whole life that all of them and none of them were home. Footage of James Baldwin and Stuart Hall, who themselves grappled with this history and its afterlife, speaks to the inspiration and comfort Thompson drew from the black cultural archive and its distinct and rigorous legacy. In Europe, Selina’s place of birth, she examines what it means to be black in a country that must grapple with its leading role in, and lasting benefits from, both slavery and colonialism. Her first sea voyage, where she encounters toxic racism and the abuse of power, becomes a contemporary replica of empire. In Ghana, she explores the complexities of grief and remembrance, and what it means to commemorate a history and a people defined by absence. On her journey between Africa and the Caribbean, she confronts her own privilege and power, granted to her by her British passport.In Jamaica, the country of her grandparents’ birth, she reflects on the nature of diasporic identity, on an island where most people’s ancestors came from somewhere else. On the final leg of her journey, overwhelmed by the weight of history and its ongoing legacy, she reaches a point of crisis, but ultimately, she does find home. Her long journey back into the past allows her, at last, to go forwards, as she closes with the quiet demand that we reckon with the past so that we can all do the same. Salt is a deeply moving account of a young woman grappling with the afterlife of slavery and colonialism. The artist in Thompson creates a performance that somehow makes the overwhelming and unsurmountable bearable for her. Steeped in anger but delivered with the lightest of touches, Salt in its essence is about love and family, whether those bonds are biological, chosen through adoption or simply the bonds inherent within the black community. In exposing her pain, and her path towards healing, Thompson lays bare a rare yet vital truth."

She meets Geoff, who visits his wife June every day following her stroke six years ago. June’s condition means she can only repeat a few phrases, and Miriam sees the love in their relationship hasn’t died but wonders if there are any other real alternatives to facing the inevitable decline.Terrified and chastened, she heads to America to meet people who believe that soon we will not only be able to ‘cure aging’ but with radical medical and technological advances we could actually ‘defeat’ death, enabling us to live forever.  In California, Miriam heads to Raad Fest - the world’s largest gathering of life enthusiasts.

Rather than meeting a ‘bunch of crackpots’ as she expected, Miriam starts to wonder whether maybe we are the ones who have got it all wrong and life doesn’t have to be so final after all. Pioneers of the super longevity movement are the eerily youthful 82-year-old Bernadene and cryotherapy enthusiast Jim. At their monthly meeting in Arizona, Miriam sees a growing community of people who are trying to achieve ‘unlimited lifespans’ by thinking and feeling differently about how we deal with death. In his -140-degree Celsius cryo chamber, Miriam learns of Jim’s philosophy that rather than waste our lives because we all think death is inevitable, why not aspire to immortality and improving the world with our wisdom? Energised but not entirely convinced, Miriam wonders if technology and a different mental attitude aren’t the only ways to stave off death.  Loma Linda, near San Diego, is one of the world’s five ‘Blue Zones’ - longevity hotspots where people live longer than anyone else on earth and residents survive ten years longer than the average American. It is also home to over 9,000 Seventh Day Adventists – strict believers in healthy living and a devotion to God. Miriam joins 71-year-old Marijke at water aerobics – part of her daily three-hour exercise regime. Surrounded by hundreds of sprightly pensioners, all preaching the gospel to fitness and Jesus, Miriam next accompanies Ida to her experimental laughter therapy session at Loma Linda’s medical university. According to university professor Dr Berk, laughter really is one of the best medicines when it comes to helping us stay healthy. In one of the research labs, hooked up to a brain scanner, pensioner Ida is in hysterics watching a series of comedy clips as Dr Berk’s team measure her neurological activity. It is good news – Ida’s brain is buzzing with positive frequencies, which helps reduce the stress hormone cortisol that attacks our immune system. The net result, he concludes, means laughter helps us stay healthier and in theory live longer. But not everyone wants to laugh their way to long life. For some, the answer to super-longevity is found in science. At the Church of Perpetual Life in Florida, Miriam meets founder Bill Falloon. His church doesn’t involve God but rather a devotion to supplements that may keep you alive long enough to allow you to benefit from scientific breakthroughs that will lead to immortality. But they don’t come cheap, and Miriam begins to wonder whether fighting death and achieving a healthy never-ending old age is beyond the pockets of most, and what this means for those who can’t afford it. Miriam discovers that for the homeless in America, living beyond 50 is statistically unlikely. Keen to see what death looks like for people with nothing, she visits the unmarked graves a pauper’s cemetery just outside Phoenix.Returning to the UK humbled, Miriam heads back to Wren Hall. Geoff’s invited her to a party, where she soon realises that while the privileged busily fret about extending their lives, for most people, the best way to deal with death is to make the most out of life."

But it was the antics of the unpredictable Ulstersman and snooker genius, Higgins, that took the game stratospheric.Raw and unpredictable on the table, outspoken and badly behaved off it, Higgins declared war on the 1970s snooker establishment, entering into a years-long rivalry with the man who more than anyone embodied the old guard, ex-policeman Ray Reardon. Higgins and Reardon didn’t see eye to eye, but it was well known that Higgins could start a fight in an empty room. As the 70s wore on, the tabloids gleefully reported on a string of on- and off-the-table misdeeds.Almost inevitably, Reardon and Higgins eventually came face to face in the World Championship final of 1982, in what was by far the biggest tournament to date. The clash of the two snooker titans - the paragon of the establishment against the self-described ‘People’s Champion’ - would be the match that redefined the British public’s relationship with the sport and set the course for a decade where it would become box office gold."

They grapple with tough, unsettling and emotional questions about being black and British in search of a way forward. Each of them has a deeply personal story to share about an event that proved to be a seismic moment in their life. They confront their differences, hoping to find answers from each other and from those who are trying to change Britain.The most radical of the group, university professor Kehinde, set up Britain's first black studies degree. He believes it's time for a fundamental change to Britain. He has a revolutionary idea to reveal to the group which could prove divisive - black-only workplaces. Although recent years have seen black leaders taking the top jobs at some big companies, at the latest count, there wasn't a single black CEO in a FTSE 100 company. At the other end of the pay scale, however, black people are overrepresented in lower-paying jobs. The group meet someone who won one of the UK's biggest race discrimination payouts in recent years and debate whether taking companies to task or race-based quotas could be the way forward. One of the panel from last year's controversial race commission report also drops in to discuss whether or not racism is still the most significant barrier holding back progression for black people in Britain.29-year-old NHS doctor Raphel has matters of the heart on his mind.  He's at a stage in life where he's looking to settle down and feeling the pressure to marry within the black community, so he wants to ask the group whether race should matter when it comes to love. Black men in Britain marry outside their race far more than white and Asian men, but black women are statistically more likely than black men to be in same-race relationships. To find out more, some of the group head off for a night out at a diverse dating event in the West Midlands to meet other single people dealing with the same dilemma.Last to reveal her story is 34-year-old property and litigation contractor Lin with an extremely personal experience that is born from her mixed heritage. 1.2 million people in the UK are mixed-race, and the numbers are growing. Lin's experience of racism from both sides of her extended family has led her to question where mixed race people fit in when it comes to being black. It strikes a chord with many in the group, raising fundamental questions about what it means to be black."

Opening in 1998, the series begins in Hyde, the small market town near Manchester that would become the setting for a murder investigation on an unprecedented scale. This episode tells the story of how the crimes of ‘respected’ GP Harold Shipman were first discovered and how he was eventually apprehended and charged with the murder of 15 of his own patients.Shipman was a popular local doctor who had been practising in Hyde for over 20 years when doubts were raised over the validity of the will left by one of his patients, Kathleen Grundy, following her death in 1998. Shipman had certified her cause of death as old age, but when the police exhumed her body, the post-mortem revealed that Mrs Grundy had in fact been killed by a fatal dose of diamorphine – pure, medical-grade heroin. That turned the case into a murder inquiry, and the victim’s GP was the prime suspect. When the police began to take a look at the deaths of several more of Shipman's recently deceased patients, the inquiry quickly snowballed into a multiple murder investigation. Shipman would eventually stand trial for the murder of 15 of his former patients from Hyde - all of them women, almost all of them elderly. Meeting victims’ close relatives and friends, former patients and the husband of another GP who spoke out against Shipman, Wilson reveals that despite compelling evidence against him, clear opportunities to catch Shipman earlier were missed. Wilson discovers how a dark chapter in the town’s past made the Shipman story even more difficult to face and explores how Shipman abused his power and status as a doctor to remain above suspicion - and even above the law.  Rather than focusing on the killer, Wilson examines the lives of some of Shipman’s elderly victims, discovering that they were fit and healthy women, active members of their local community who were well loved by their families and friends. Although these women were elderly, their deaths were mostly unexpected, and yet Shipman was able to pass their deaths off as due to natural causes. The programme ends on the eve of Shipman’s trial. He was charged with 15 murders, but the police investigated over 100 other suspicious deaths, the vast majority of whom were elderly patients. Even though this was to be the biggest murder trial in British history, it was clear that the true scale of Shipman’s crimes, and a full examination of how he had evaded detection for so long, would only begin to emerge after the court case.

When Beckham starts a relationship with ‘Posh Spice’ Victoria Adams, the pair are catapulted onto the pages of every gossip column.But for every David Beckham there has to be a casualty who isn’t quite so fortunate.Keith Gillespie was once dubbed ‘the new George Best’ and yet his journey through the 90s couldn’t be more divergent from that of David Beckham. The pair had been friends and were both members of United’s so-called Class of 92 who went on to form the backbone of their success through the next decadeAfter a whirlwind start at Manchester United, Gillespie was deemed surplus to requirements and off-loaded to title rivals Newcastle United. While there was no drop in his form, the loneliness of living in a strange town away from the Man United youth team players he’d grown up with, led Gillespie to seek solace in the local bookmakers.  In another era Gillespie may have been able to ask for help but his gambling habit went from bad to worse before he was inevitably “outed’ by a tabloid newspaper. On the pitch, Gillespie and Beckham each have their sights set on their first Premier League winners medal. The 1995/96 season concludes with a dramatic showdown – either Newcastle or Manchester United side will be crowned champions on the final day."

The waterhole area is totally transformed into a lush grazing pasture, and a pair of Egyptian geese take up permanent residence on the waterhole’s edge. This time of year can be harder for predators, as prey can migrate further and temperatures are not as extreme as during previous seasons. Using the remote cameras, Chris and the team reveal how the waterhole hyena clan copes with these new circumstances. Ella uncovers the huge shift in the waterhole timetable and new competition flooding into the area: wildebeest. The great migration follows the pattern of the rains, and it is pushing wildebeest herds numbering in the thousands towards Mwiba Wildlife Reserve. These grazing animals move en masse and require a lot of food and water wherever they are – will this put further pressure on the waterhole residents? Following the herds of wildebeest are predators from across the region that stalk them, waiting for an opportunity to go in for the kill. These new predators may pose a threat to the waterhole area and challenge the hyena to their territory. As the rains continue, it is not just the landscape around the waterhole that alters. With food and water in abundance, it is birthing season for many herbivores, but how will an increase in population affect the waterhole area? At the end of the rainy season, Ella delves into the data to discover how animals have used the waterhole across the past three seasons: which animals drank the most? How many animals came in total? And, out of all of them, which species came the most frequently?"

In the art of Piet Mondrian, James explores how an artist who began life as a landscape painter gradually leaves nature behind, tidying up the messy reality of nature into abstract lines. We meet Chinese artist Yang Yongliang on the streets of New York, whose sprawling digital landscapes ask questions about our drive for rapid urbanisation.James continues to explore this story through the images of one of the best photographers of the last century – and one of its most brilliant women - Margaret Bourke-White. In 1930, she was the first professional western photographer to be allowed into the Soviet Union, where she captured the rapid transformation of the country from being largely rural into a modern, industrial state. James moves on to explore how the destructive power of the atomic age both terrified and inspired artists in the 1940s and 1950s, from painters like Bittinger to the world of sci-fi films.We then see the arrival of a new kind of art – land art. In the late 60s and 70s, a growing number of artists left the city and started working not only in nature but with it. We meet two contemporary land artists based in New Zealand: Philippa Jones and Martin Hill, who use natural materials to create sculptures in the landscapes of New Zealand’s South Island. And finally, we explore how artist collective Random International are using technology to explore our future relationship with nature – through a series of mesmerising art works.James finishes the episode and the series asking questions of the interviewees who have appeared across the series. How do they see our future relationship with nature?He concludes that on the long journey we humans have been on since our beginnings, artists have played a vital role not only in reflecting but also shaping our attitudes to nature. They’ve helped us understand its intricacy, appreciate its beauty, and now – when the entire planet seems under threat – they can help us forge a new relationship with it."

A father of two has been fatally stabbed to death and senior murder detective DCI John Bent and his team must scramble to investigate in a case where there is little time or room for contemplation.

John has to employ every tactic in the book to track him down 'There’s no bigger responsibility and privilege than investigating the death of another.

From California to small-town Arizona, the royal couple promote Britain by day and party by night. They attend a dinner with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton in a world where Hollywood royalty increasingly competes with the real thing. In Britain, the press starts to ask if the extravagant royal tour is a good way to spend public money. The mystique of monarchy is being increasingly undermined by the emergence of a more open and egalitarian society.In the years that follow, Anthony Armstrong-Jones begins to withdraw from royal duties and the couple lead increasingly separate lives. Press speculation about the state of their marriage intensifies. In the 1970s Margaret retreats more and more to the Caribbean island of Mustique in an attempt to secure a private life.

Given the choice, she would happily swap it for Claudia Winkleman’s - but she knows that is never going to happen. In her words, Miriam has been fat ever since she can remember – it has overshadowed her life. Now aged 78, she knows time to do something about it is running out.In this series, Miriam travels the country to discover why, despite so much information about healthy lifestyles, our nation is at its most overweight ever. She wants to understand what impact being obese has on people and how the rest of society views them. She begins in this episode by meeting people fighting back against their size – physically and psychologically.She checks in to a bootcamp and meets 30-year-old Georgia, who has been struggling with serious binge eating since university. The camp is run along military lines with a calorie-restricted diet and five hours of enforced exercise per day. Georgia has lost seven stone and is getting back on track, but Miriam fears, away from the regimented life at boot camp, she might flounder in an outside world full of temptation.Will is only 20 but already 28 stone. Now at university, he worries how he will be perceived if he can’t join in with activities and ‘fit in’. He has decided to do something about it, booking himself in for a brutal six-week intense weight-loss programme. It is a tough but worthwhile path he hopes will lead to acceptance.Wanting acceptance is something Miriam understands. She has found ways to approach being overweight which mainly involve being loud and frank about her size. But the ridicule she faced for being fat has still left its mark. Laughing at people for being obese still seems to be an accepted form of prejudice, she muses, with people who are overweight seen as fair game. Miriam questions it further as she hears about the human experiences of struggle against obesity. She meets Liverpool University behavioural psychologist Dr Eric Robinson, who tests the psychological effects of being obese by having students wear a 'fat suit', and in another experiment’s results, Miriam is shocked to learn how deeply embedded society’s disdain for obese people really is.Meeting Georgia again at her mother’s seaside home, Miriam finds her well on the way to recovery. But there was a time when Georgia’s mother really struggled supporting her daughter through depression and overeating, even fearing her daughter wouldn’t see her 30th birthday. Now she is proud and relieved as Georgia continues to build her mental stamina and lose weight in a bid for happiness.Perplexed and bewildered, Miriam turns to best mate Carol. She wants to know if losing weight is the simple route to a happier life. Straight-talking Carol has never known a ‘slim Miriam’ and says she wouldn’t want to. Realising size is only one element of who we are, Miriam starts to wonder if maybe hating your body isn’t the way forward. She embarks on a journey into the world of BoPo – the body positive movement. Being ‘fat and happy’ goes against everything Miriam ever thought possible – surely every fat person hates themselves and wants to be thinner like she does? And what about the health aspects? Step forward, plus-sized fashion blogger Bethany. She has no interest in diets, feeling bad about her body or not eating whatever she fancies whenever she wants. She tells Miriam being happy living her life ‘fat’ makes much more sense than yo-yo dieting and desperately trying (and failing) to fit someone else’s idea of the perfect body. Her knockout blow lands as she points out that Miriam has hated her body all her life and it hasn’t made her thin or happy, so where is the sense in that? It is an interesting point for Miriam to chew over as she heads to meet body confidence powerhouse Trina. Trina doesn’t do ‘slim.’ Instead, she believes finding happiness in who you are, not what you or society expect you to look like, is the way forward. Cautiously sceptical, Miriam agrees to attend one of the UK’s first plus-size dance classes with 25 big, proud women embracing the joys of twerking and eventually encouraging Miriam to do the same! It is a life-changing experience which makes Miriam realise tackling obesity is a complex problem with no one-size-fits-all solution, but that in the pursuit of happiness, maybe acceptance and embracing people of all shapes and sizes is a good thing."

This is the day that investors have been told the mining company will pour the first molten gold. Processing plant manager Nigel is taking on the challenge of turning the crushed quartz vein into gold. Despite not being the quantity they had hoped for, it is both a success and a major step in showing they can be a working goldmine."

Over time, it has given rise to more unique plants and animals, from its lemurs to chameleons, than any other island.","Journey across the tropical island of Madagascar and explore the unique and incredible wildlife it has to offer - from its famed lemurs to chameleons. As the oldest island on Earth, life has had time to evolve, and there are now more unique plants and animals on Madagascar than any other island.It was formed nearly 90 million years ago when a giant landmass split apart, and Madagascar was cast adrift from east Africa. Braving the 400-mile ocean crossing from Africa, the first castaways arrived on the arid west of the island, and were met with vast deserts.  Ring-tailed lemurs are the direct descendants of one of the very first mammals to arrive, and they are thriving despite the arid conditions. They spend up to eight hours a day foraging in the Spiny Forest. Their plant-based diet includes plants with caustic sap that would burn human skin.When humans arrived on the west coast, they too faced the hostile desert, high temperatures and droughts that can last a year. In the village of Ampotaka, the people have learnt to use baobab trees to help them survive. The trees grow up to 30 metres high and stores vast quantities of water in their trunks. By hollowing out the inside of the trunk, the people create huge water tanks storing thousands of litres of water, which they can use when times are tough.Tiny labord’s chameleons are unique to Madagascar and have the shortest lifespan of any land vertebrate – living for just four months. They time their hatching with the start of the rainy season when the going is good, and then the race is on for them to grow, mate and lay eggs before the dry season comes round once again.One of the most dramatic places in Madagascar is known as the Grand Tsingy – 500 square miles of sharp limestone pinnacles sheltering small pockets of forest. To survive here, Decken’s sifakas must climb these shards of rock, sharp enough to shred human skin, and leap 30 feet between them.A series of even higher peaks forms a mountainous spine running down the middle of Madagascar. Just a few thousand years ago, human settlers from Asia brought the skills to turn the steep mountainsides into rice paddies. By digging terraces into the slopes, even the steepest gradients can be farmed, producing more than a million tonnes of rice every year. But only if they can keep their crop safe from the devastating plagues of locusts in their billions.Madagascar’s mountain range defines the islands’ climate. It blocks warm, wet air blown in off the Indian Ocean to the east, creating the arid deserts of the west. But keeping all this moisture to the eastern side of the island makes rainfall high there, and this creates bountiful rainforests.Most of the island’s incredible wildlife can be found within these tropical rainforests, including tenrecs, Madagascar’s own unique version of a hedgehog. They give birth to more babies than any mammals – as many as 32 in a litter. The streaked tenrec rubs together modified spines on her back to make a squeaking noise to warn all her babies of danger.The extraordinary pelican spider twangs the threads of an orb web spider to lure it into its giant jaws. The aye-aye is one of Madagascar’s weirdest creatures, found hunting for insect larvae at night. It uses it bizarre 9cm-long middle finger to tap tree branches for hollow bits, before scraping away the bark and deploying its super-sized finger to fish out the grubs.Madagascar’s unique wildlife has slowly been evolving for millions of years, but since humans arrived the pace of change has been faster than many animals can cope with. As little as 20 per cent of the island’s original forest remains, and 95 per cent of lemurs are now threatened with extinction.The greater bamboo lemur is a story of how efforts to protect Madagascar’s wildlife can save a species from being wiped out entirely. These lemurs were thought to have gone extinct, thanks to the clearance of the bamboo forests they rely on for food. The bamboo lemurs are now protected and in the last year, a record number of babies were born. Madagascar is at a critical point, but with the right efforts, there is some hope for its wildlife in the future."

As well as being a gifted multi-instrumentalist and composer, Phil is also a self-confessed audio geek and a passionate lover of the natural world, and field recordings captured while filming will both inspire and feature in his final composition."

Most patients have conditions that are familiar to experienced surgeons, but occasionally the teams must tackle much rarer and more challenging cases. Consultant maxillofacial surgeon Tim Martin and his operating partner Sat Parmar are planning a marathon operation on former police officer Loretta. As far as they can tell from medical records, they will be the first UK surgeons to operate on the strange disease Loretta is suffering from. Nine months earlier, Loretta appeared in Tim’s clinic with a mysterious condition that was destroying the bones and muscles in one side of her face, causing her mouth to fuse shut. After much detective work, the team arrived at a diagnosis of tumefactive fibroinflammatory disease – a condition so rare, Tim could only dig up some 50 documented cases worldwide.As all non-surgical treatments, including chemotherapy, have failed to halt the damage being done by the disease, and Loretta is now at serious risk of a fatal stroke, Tim is left with only one option: major surgery to remove the diseased area, followed by complex facial reconstruction. But operating without established medical protocol, on diseased tissue with unknown characteristics, makes Tim very uncomfortable.The procedure involves radical surgery to the entire left-hand side of Loretta’s face, and means she will lose a section of her upper jaw, as well as facial muscles that have tough and hardened. It is a daunting prospect for both patient and surgeon. Having come to consider Loretta a friend during the lengthy period planning the surgery, Tim feels even more pressure than usual to get a good result.Removing the diseased area will save Loretta’s life, but the surgeons know it will be devastating for her if she is left badly disfigured. To give her best possible outcome, they intend to fill the cavity left in her face with a section of bone and muscle removed from her hip.They will draw on the Queen Elizabeth’s on-site maxillofacial prosthetics laboratory. Here technicians have adapted the latest 3D design techniques to transform patient scans into bespoke 3D-printed cutting guides. In theatre, these enable the surgeons to cut out the correct amount of bone from the face, and also cut a graft from the hip bone that will then slot into the hole in the face with total precision. This absolute accuracy has transformed the success rates for surgery, and achieves better cosmetic results for patients. During the all-day procedure, it isn’t long before the disease’s unpredictable characteristics put the team under severe pressure. Tim must keep working methodically in spite of the stress he feels when a bleed from a ruptured blood vessel that would usually be simple to control becomes a major challenge, due to the effects of Loretta’s unusual condition.The programme also features consultant neurosurgeon Alex Paluzzi, who is taking on one of the toughest cases of his career too. His patient, 64-year-old Norah, fractured her neck while on a fairground ride with her grandchildren. A scan revealed that she had a rare and aggressive tumour called a clival chordoma, which had not only weakened the bones of her neck, but also wrapped itself around her brainstem – putting her life in imminent danger. As it is located in the area where all the nerves of the body plug in to the brain, attempting to remove the tumour surgically is fraught with danger. The big question Alex faces is, will operating cause more harm than good?Hoping for the best, Norah gives the go ahead, so Alex attempts two approaches, tackling the tumour first from the front via the nose, then from the rear.  In order to reach the 'enemy', Alex has to remove a 'window' of skull bone from behind Norah’s ear and then navigate a series of vital nerves without damaging them – if he does Norah may lose her ability to speak or breathe. He describes it as being like ‘operating through prison bars’.With exceptional access to surgeons, anaesthetists, theatre staff and their patients, and filmed with specialist fixed-rig cameras, head-cams and microscope feeds, Surgeons: At the Edge of Life offers a unique insight into the sort of person it takes to be a surgeon taking responsibility for the most demanding procedures possible."

After leading his party to a surprise electoral victory in 2015, which saw him win a Conservative majority, Cameron's renegotiation faced huge challenges from the start. He struggled to persuade his two closest allies, Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, to support the case for remaining, which left him struggling to stay in control of a campaign riven by party in-fighting, 'post-truth' politics and strategic challenges."

Four years ago, Christian Lewis started walking. He set off from Llangennith beach, close to his home in Swansea back in August 2017, with just £10 in his pocket. As an ex-paratrooper, he was well-equipped to take on this challenge, and his main purpose of doing the walk was to raise money for SSAFA, an armed forces charity, that had helped him through some turbulent times. It has turned into a journey of adventure and self-discovery.As he travelled around the coastline of Wales, England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, Christian took to social media to share his experiences and gained over 80,000 followers, all of whom feel a part of his journey. Many have kindly contributed food, water, accommodation and equipment to help him on each leg of the journey.  He felt he was unstoppable, but in March 2020, 12,000 miles from his home in Wales, Covid-19 hit, and the world came to a standstill. Chris found himself on the uninhabited island of Hildasay in Shetland, unable to move on because of lockdown. This was isolation on another level, with only his adopted dog Jet for company. Chris’s military skills certainly helped him survive in the wild, as he had to forage and hunt for his food, and his posts proved inspirational for a population struggling with the lockdown. Chris’s journey became much more than a feat of physical endurance and surviving the elements - it helped him find inner peace and love. After Chris left the army and his daughter left for college, he suffered from depression. Through the kindness of strangers and by meeting people from all walks of life, Chris became happier and more content with himself. Then at the end of 2020, the most unexpected thing happened. After being a single man for ten years, he met Kate. They instantly hit it off, their relationship developed into love, and she has now joined Chris and Jet on their walk. The second lockdown meant that Chis and Kate spent the coldest months of the year holed up in a homemade wooden shelter in a wood south of Aberdeen. But as spring comes and lockdown restrictions lift, they head down the spectacular east coast of Scotland and on to the streets of the capital city. Although this walk has taken longer than anticipated, as he comes to the final year of his journey and he makes his long walk back home to Wales, so much has changed for Chris. He has met thousands of people who have inspired him, adopted a dog, found love, and most of all he is happy and determined to complete his extraordinary journey."

The invention of writing about 5,000 years ago made civilisation itself possible, and every innovation of the modern world is based on the foundation of the written word. But how and where did writing begin, and who began it? In From Pictures to Words, the first of three films about the history of writing, we uncover the hidden links between all the diverse writing systems in use today and trace the origin of our own alphabet to a turquoise mine in the Sinai Desert and a man riding a donkey whose name was Khebded. Writing is a recent innovation. Our species has existed for about 300,000 years, and for all but the last 5,000 of them, people had to record and transmit vital knowledge without the aid of writing. At the Moon Dreaming site in the Northern Territory of Australia, Yidumduma Bill Harney, an elder of the Aboriginal Wardaman people, explains how Aboriginal culture has been transmitted down the generations orally, without the need to write anything down. So, why did people eventually feel the need to make permanent records in visual form? According to Irving Finkel, an Assyriologist from the British Museum, it was in Mesopotamia, modern-day Iraq, where the need for record-keeping was first felt. Here, about 5,000 years ago, the Sumerians developed the first city states. The city dwellers depended for their sustenance on taxing the surrounding countryside, and Irving produces a clay tablet from this period that is the distant ancestor of today’s spreadsheet: a grid of boxes ruled into the clay, with symbols that represent numbers, and small stylised pictures that represent commodities, such as an ear of barley. These so-called pictograms would be the basis for the first writing systems, and so we owe writing to the first accountants and tax inspectors. But the language of accountancy is limited. To represent the full vocabulary of the Sumerian people would require a key conceptual leap, a way to use pictures to represent not things but sounds. This is what Irving dubs the giant leap for mankind, something called the Rebus Principle: the idea is that a picture of an ear of barley can represent barley, but it can also be used to represent the sound of the word barley in Sumerian, which is pronounced ‘sheh’. Thus, the word ‘sheh-ga’, which means ‘beautiful’, can be represented by the pictogram of an ear of barley, followed by the stylised picture of a cow’s udder, which stands for milk, pronounced ‘ga’ in Sumerian. The Rebus Principle is the key that unlocked writing for all the peoples of the ancient near east. Egyptian hieroglyphs, which developed in the same period, are also based on the same principle. The earliest known complete Egyptian text is found beneath a pyramid near Cairo, inscribed on the walls of the tomb of Pharaoh Teti. The Pyramid Texts are a series of elaborate magic spells, designed to raise Teti to eternal life. Hieroglyphs are indeed magic, because like all writing, while they may not be able raise the dead, they do allow them to speak. In fact, the Rebus lies behind all the ancient writing systems of the world. The earliest known Chinese writing is found inscribed on bones and turtle shells from 3,500 years ago. Chinese is a picture-based script that uses the Rebus Principle to represent sounds with stylised pictures. The same is true of Mayan glyphs, a writing system that developed in Central America about 2,600 years ago. The similarities between these scripts is striking. Is this evidence of a common root for all writing? In essence, the Rebus Principle is simply a sort of pun, something that could have occurred to a child. Irving Finkel believes that it was invented many times, as a natural expression of a common human sense of humour! The similarities between ancient writing systems are simply due to the fact that we all share the same human mind. But today, most people write using alphabets – simple scripts with just a few dozen symbols that seem to have no connection to pictures. Here the story is different, because the alphabet was only invented once. In the company of archaeologist Pierre Tallet, we travel to the Sinai to an ancient Egyptian temple perched high above the desert. This is the place where the cultural exchange between Egyptian scribes and illiterate Canaanite migrant workers created a new kind of script. This script also used the Rebus Principle, but in a radically simpler way, adapting hieroglyphic pictograms to represent the sounds of the Canaanite tongue. Almost every alphabet in use today, from Arabic to the Latin alphabet, can trace its origins to this script. Our letters do not look like pictures, but in fact in almost every word we write lie hidden the ghosts of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs."

This is the inside story of its climb back to reopening.","The series begins in spring 2019, when the Metropolitan Museum of Art is in its pomp – the coffers full, visitor numbers are up and staff preparing to mark, in one year's time, the museum’s 150th anniversary. The museum has long been planning a series of stand-out exhibitions and events. The art press gather for a breakfast in the American Wing sculpture court, surrounded by treasures reflecting the tastes of the philanthropist founders of the Metropolitan. These were new-money industrialists and financiers, who believed that the lives of New York's teeming millions would be improved by their proximity to beauty. That beauty, however, was vested almost exclusively in the European arts and the artefacts of classical civilisations. The museum is aware that the tastes of the Gilded Age aren't for everyone, and a dance display by the House of Gorgeous shows they're awake to the woke.In his fifth-floor office sits Met president and CEO Dan Weiss, the art historian recently appointed to steer the largest art museum in the Americas out of a period of falling visitor numbers and financial turbulence. Overlooking Central Park, he revels in a painting by Alfred Sisley, a print of which once graced his college digs. Those who built the Met in 1870 wanted an American Louvre, an audacious vision, he says, considering they had no art. The likes of JP Morgan, a previous president, simply spent and lent big, snapping up artefacts all over the world and donating their own collections. Weiss is also spending big for next year's special exhibitions and, with the Met’s director Max Hollein, planning a slew of great events. He's also splashing out on capital projects like the new six-acre glass roof for the European Paintings gallery, at $150m, just one improvement that will make 2020 a landmark year.  The inner workings of the Met are revealed with excursions into various departments, and the warren of labs, workrooms and archives above and deep below the public areas. In the Arms and Armour workshops, they're repairing gauntlets before sending some of their massive collection off to Vienna, and preparing for the arrival from Europe of new old iron and steel for a great show of German armour, The Last Knight.There's more quiet frenzy in the Costume Institute. The conservators have just recovered from the 2019 Met Gala, the starry night where celebrities parade for the camera and make the donations that fund this department. Staff have just delivered this year’s annual show, Camp, a pink celebration of costume drama that is pulling in the crowds. In the next room, they're amassing black garments for the monster 2020 show currently being crafted by British uber-designer Es Devlin.  The film drills deepest into preparations for a show about British mercantile expansion and its impact on interior design. Assistant curator Dr Wolf Burchard has been spirited from the National Trust to Fifth Avenue, his mission: to tell a 500-year story of enterprise from the Tudor to Victorian eras. The museum's existing British galleries are being remodelled for the occasion, and Burchard and his team must navigate the construction works to create a display of 700 items. They've got a £20m budget and seven months.  Two floors up, colleagues face similar time challenges as they build the keystone exhibition Making the Met. It tells the tale of the museum's 15 decades using objects from every department, and new ones donated by sponsors and benefactors. Outside, Austrian Max Hollein, only a few months in post, leads the drive to make the Met feel more modern, diverse and inclusive. For the first time since the austere Beaux-Arts building opened, niches in the exterior are filled with art - a series of bronzes by Kenyan-born artist Wangechi Mutu. She tells how groundbreaking this initiative is.  The Met is on a roll. We are with the glitterati flocking across the Upper East Side for a private viewing of the British exhibition. The public opening of the new galleries, on 2 March 2020, heralds the start of the 150th year programme. Curator Burchard says how strange it feels to have his galleries packed with thousands.  That very same night, the first victim of Covid-19 is in hospital. Within days, the Met will be the first large institution in the city to lock down. As New York becomes a ghost town, viewers are on the inside watching the museum trying to protect one million exhibits from light damage and moths, wrestling with 20 per cent staff cuts and losses of $150m, while working towards a reopening, sometime in an uncertain future. When that day comes, we witness emotional scenes that underline a truth: that New Yorkers regard the Met as their own. More than just a museum, it's a resource and a refuge."

Often called art's greatest showman and the world's first celebrity artist, Dali shamelessly used TV to promote his art and himself. Dali's striking, dreamlike images made his name synonymous with surrealism, and he shocked the world through film, fashion, sculpture and architecture.In this account, David hunts through dozens of BBC programmes to try to understand the real Salvador Dali, not just the more familiar eccentric show-off. Taking in films presented down the decades by Robert Hughes, Sister Wendy and Philippa Perry, David's rich dive into the archives, including Dali’s own films, reveals how our understanding of the artist has changed dramatically over the years.Whatever the era, Dali has always been important to programme makers – so much so that on BBC Four’s launch night in 2002, one of the broadcasts was a star-studded and surreal comic exploration of Dali's early career, featuring Stephen Fry, Matt Lucas and Ewen Bremner. David also delves into Dali's fractured relationship with the surrealists and his own family, and his life-long passion for his wife Gala, who was the engine behind his later career and helped him take America by storm."

John’s research has focused on child homicide and domestic abuse, and they discuss how both profession and time of year can play a part in family annihilations.David’s last guest is Ann Marie Cocozza, who co-founded a charity that helps the families of murder victims after her nephew was murdered in 2004. Ann Marie tells David about the little-known trauma inflicted on families in the aftermath of a murder - the loss of home, of personal items, and the earth-shattering grief that comes from losing someone by murder."

With his Birmingham gang, Billy rises to dominate the illegal money-spinning rackets around horse racing at the start of the 20th century.World War I disrupts his quest to build an empire, but after the war Kimber moves south to take over the rackets in the lucrative southern English racecourses. This brings him into conflict with powerful London gangs, including Jewish bookmakers like Alfie Solomon and Edward Emanuel, who seek help from the notorious Sabini Gang of Clerkenwell’s Little Italy. It leads to the racecourse wars of 1921, with hundreds of gangsters fighting pitched battles for control of Britain’s racecourses.The boom in horse racing and its associated off- and on-course betting is fertile ground for gangsters who want to both control the trade and carve up the rich pickings from protection and extortion on Britain’s racecourses.

He then moves to 16th-century Venice, where masterpieces such as Giovanni Bellini's San Zaccaria altarpiece and Titian's Bacchus and Ariadne contested the assumption that drawing would always be superior to colouring. As the Baroque took hold in enlightenment Europe another Venetian, Giambattista Tiepolo, created a ceiling fresco Apollo and the Four Continents at the Bishop's palace in WÃ¼rzburg.In a glorious sequence Simon celebrates this grand opera of light, colour, and dancing line: a dizzying lift-off into 18th-century elation.

The art of colour discovered a new mission which somehow sustained the old: how to make life in cities bearable, even beautiful.

These prints by artists such as Hokusai were hugely influential on the impressionists and postimpressionists. Simon ends the film in Matisse's great chapel at Vence, where colour is used - against a backdrop of the Second World War - once more to enrapture, enlighten and as a path to God."

In the early 70s, Memphis was the capital of gospel-infused soul music, thanks to two key labels. One was Stax, the other was Hi Records - a high church of soul presided over by Al Green whose Let’s Stay Together pre-figured a new type of soul man, one who would come to dominate the 70s - a sensitive lover man.In Philadelphia, a new record label was born that would also soften soul’s hard edges. Philadelphia International Records was home to Harold Melvin and the Bluenotes, from whose ranks Teddy Pendergrass would emerge. PIR was also home to the O’Jays, who embodied Philadelphia’s message of love and togetherness.Fresh from the monumental success of What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye went to work on his follow-up, shifting focus from the streets to the bedroom with Let’s Get It On. Bedroom soul was also epitomised by the sensitive, thoughtful Barry White, whose deep baritone put both black and white audiences in the mood. In the mid-70s, disco became a lucrative sideline for female singers who delivered first-hand songs about love, loss and empowerment such as Candi Staton’s Young Hearts Run Free, whilst Millie Jackson did what the soul men did, only more so, telling it like it was. This episode also looks at the Quiet Storm radio format, conceived by billionaire entrepreneur Cathy Hughes, targeted at a black female audience. The title was borrowed from Smokey Robinson’s 1975 album of laid-back soul ballads, and the genre helped make stars of artists such as Peabo Bryson, whose smooth ballads led the listener discretely to the bedroom door.The tragic death of Marvin Gaye, on the back of his biggest success - Sexual Healing - and the paralysis of Teddy Pendergrass seemed like bad omens for soul in the 80s. But one artist filled the gap. New York-born Luther Vandross started out as one of the most in-demand backing vocalists before redefining soul with Never Too Much. Luther may have been the 80s soul king, but he did not rule alone. Anita Baker was the queen. Her 1986 hit album Rapture pursued a similar, contemporary yet retro take on soul. However, Luther couldn’t hold back the tide forever. The birth of hip hop as a political force and the arrival of MTV closed the door on soul, ushering in a new era for black music. The soul epoch may have been over, but the music never went away and, from time to time, it resurfaces in all its glory.  With The O’Jays, Al ‘Fonzi’ Thornton, Marcus Miller, Nat Adderley Jr, Jerry Cummings, Charles Hodges, Candi Staton, Peabo Bryson, Millie Jackson and Cathy Hughes. Expert analysis from Mark Anthony Neal, David Ritz and Nelson George."

It's a vast marine desert where there is little to eat and nowhere to hide. Yet it's home to some of the biggest and most spectacular creatures on earth.This episode reveals what it takes to survive in this savage and forbidding world. We witness feats of incredible endurance, moments of high drama and extraordinary acts of heart-wrenching self-sacrifice.Every animal in the big blue must find their own unique way to survive. Sperm whales have the largest brains in the world. They live for 80 years, and we are only now beginning to learn the extraordinary complexity of their language of clicks - thought to coordinate the whole family in everything from childcare to hunting. With special pressure-proof cameras, we witness record-breaking feats of endurance as they hunt for squid a kilometre down into the abyss.Many smaller creatures find sanctuary in this great wilderness. Only recently have we begun to solve the mystery of where baby turtles disappear to in their early years. They leave the crowded waters of the coast and head to the open ocean, where they use floating debris like logs as life rafts. Here they remain until adulthood, adrift on the high seas in relative safety away from coastal predators.Over half of all animals in the open ocean drift in currents. Jellyfish cross entire oceans feeding on whatever happens to tangle with their tentacles. The jelly-like Portuguese man-of-war can harness sail power to fish with its deadly tentacles. Sometimes there is a brief explosion of food in this marine desert, but ocean hunters must be fast to make the best of this bonanza. We witness super pods of up to 5,000 spinner dolphins racing to herd vast shoals of lanternfish, briefly caught at the surface where it is thought they spawn. New aerial footage reveals, for the first time, the truth to a centuries-old sailors' legend of the 'boiling seas' - the spectacular feeding frenzy of 90kg tuna and dolphins smashing through the lantern fish shoals turning the sea white with foam.Raising your young in this great wilderness is a huge challenge. The episode follows two very different ocean voyagers that show amazing care. We get closer to solving the mystery of where the biggest fish in the sea, the whale shark, gives birth. The pregnant females make an epic journey across the Pacific to the Galapagos Islands. Scientists now think it might be here that the pregnant females give birth to their pups in the safety of the depths. And in the freezing south Atlantic, a pair of ageing wandering albatrosses give their all to raise their very last chick.Yet even in the big blue, thousands of kilometres from land, there is evidence of human activity. An estimated eight million tons of plastic is dumped into the oceans every year. Globe-spanning currents carry it into the heart of every ocean, often with tragic consequences. In the Atlantic waters off Europe we follow a family of pilot whales whose calf has recently died. One possible cause of death is poisoning by its own mother's contaminated milk. As plastic breaks down it combines with other pollutants that are consumed by vast numbers of marine creatures. In top predators like pilot whales, the toxic chemicals can build up to lethal levels."

On the outskirts of Denver Colorado, Stacey immerses herself in the world of a group of bounty hunters, led by husband and wife duo Scott and Lydia Gribble. They hunt down fugitives every day, locking up as many as eleven bail dodgers a week. She sees them force their way into properties, interrogate accomplices and taser and handcuff defendants who’ve gone on the run. Stacey sees the lengths the bounty hunters will go to capture a fugitive and get paid. In America, defendants who are too poor to bail themselves out of jail rely on bondsmen to loan them their bail money. But when they don’t play by the rules the bondsmen can send bounty hunters to go find them and bring them back to court – so the bondsman doesn’t lose his money. These bounty hunters have sweeping powers and in all states but four (Wisconsin, Illinois, Kentucky and Oregon), nearly anyone, with very little training, can pick up a gun and hunt down fugitives who have gone on the run. Bounty hunters have been part of the American justice system since the 1800s, a system which uses money to make sure people don’t run away after they’ve been charged with a crime. And if defendants do go on the run, paying bounty hunters to go get them means they won’t get away. It’s a $14 billion private industry that does the job that in the UK falls to the government and police, with bondsmen making money from every defendant who needs their help and bounty hunters making money from every fugitive they capture. Alongside the bounty hunting profession, Stacey learns how the commercial bail system works in America. Robert Boykin is the owner of Hope Bail Bonds. He pays Scott and the gang to hunt down fugitives who have skipped on the bail he has loaned the defendants, for a price. Robert says he is helping people - getting defendants out of jail who cannot afford bail on their own, while they wait for their trial. Stacey meets and interviews the fugitives who Scott and his team arrest as well as the people around them. She learns that relatives and friends become ‘co-signers’ who play an important role in this system. They sign a contract with the bondsman and are legally bound to help the bounty hunters find the defendant if they go on the run. They also have to pay for the bounty hunters and any other costs. Stacey meets 29-year-old Keri, who lives with her husband, grandmother and children. Keri was arrested for assaulting an ex-boyfriend, was bailed out by Hope Bail Bonds but then didn’t go to court. So Scott goes to find her and bring her back to jail. She follows the bounty hunters as they go after 21-year-old Bryce, who has missed numerous court dates but now has a job at McDonalds. She sees Scott interrogate 17-year-old Image, whose mother is the co-signer for a fugitive on the run. And in a run-down part of the city, Stacey sees the bounty hunters taser an aging meth addict who is hiding out in a drug house. Stacey learns that defendants like these rely on bondsmen like Robert because they don’t have enough money to bail themselves out. And if they fail to play by the rules, she sees that they can soon find themselves in real difficulties, with their debts going up and bounty hunters at their door. The bounty hunters and bondsmen believe this for-profit system is the most efficient way of getting people to face justice. But it seems that the poorest and most vulnerable in society pay the highest price. As more Americans than ever before rely on the bail industry, Stacey asks what happens when you put a price on people’s freedom?"

In this powerful and sensitively told Storyville documentary, set in America, three parents share their personal stories. Jeff Williams is the father of Andy, who in 2001, at the age of 15, shot and killed two classmates and wounded 13 other students. Andy, 25 at the time of filming, is now serving life in prison. Clarence Elliot’s son Nicholas shot and killed his teacher and wounded another in 1988. He too is serving life in prison. Sue Klebold’s son Dylan was one of the two teenagers behind the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, one of the deadliest school shootings in history. Dylan ended the shooting by committing suicide.Through the three parents' deeply personal stories and raw, honest testimony, the film explores multiple themes that emerge from terrible tragedies - guilt, failure, responsibility, sorrow, friendship and love."

Despairing of the capability of the police and the courts to protect them, many have turned to an industry of private security, offering protection for a price. Are the sometimes brutal methods of these private police really a solution or just another part of the problem?The first stop for Louis is a meeting with William Mayangoni, the local co-ordinator for a security firm known as Mapogo. Based on the outskirts of Diepsloot, one of the squatter camps that ring Johannesburg, William investigates thefts for his mainly white clients. When he catches a suspect, he gives them 'medicine': the alleged offender is beaten with a leather whip known as a sjambok.Although his clients seem to support what they see as 'an African solution to an African problem', William's methods alienate the people of Diepsloot. Finally, their patience snaps dramatically, and William has to call out the real police in order to protect himself from the vicious threat of the mob.In the centre of Johannesburg, a security company called Bad Boyz work in an area called Hillbrow, notorious for its high crime rate. Louis meets company director Hendrik De Klerk who explains that much of their activity involves reclaiming and securing buildings that have been taken over, or hijacked, by criminal gangs who illegally take rent from tenants. Louis watches dramatic evictions unfold, in which the police and security companies are not afraid to use force to kick out the protesting residents."

According to UK Space Agency, its annual income now stands at £16.4bn, and it employs over 45,000 people. Britain has always been a leader in the world’s aerospace industries. Airbus’s huge manufacturing plant in Stevenage was originally owned by de Havilland, where they made ‘Blue Streak’, Britain’s intercontinental ballistic missile which became part of the ESA's 'Europa' rocket. Before becoming part of Airbus, the business then called Astrium had focused on satellites and were Maggie’s employers.Maggie meets Liz Seward who explains that while over half their business is building communications satellites, they are also involved in research instruments too. One of their recent creations – the Solar Orbiter – has not yet reached its final operational position in space, but has recently sent back spectacular pictures of coronal mass ejections. Back in the factory, Maggie sees a new satellite in the making. ‘Biomass’ is a European Space Agency project that will measure the amount of carbon trapped in the earth’s flora, building up a comprehensive 3D picture of the planet’s greenery. This is done using a specific type of radar that uses comparatively long wavelengths and consequently requires a huge 15m receiver – which in turn creates a huge challenge for its designers. There are a vast number of job types required to build a spacecraft – and Maggie discovers perhaps the most surprising – that of crystal maker. Airbus in Stevenage is the manufacturer of the world’s purest quartz crystal. It is needed several times over in every satellite for calibration purposes. Because quartz vibrates at a specific frequency when an electrical current is applied to it, it is a vital constant in a world of wandering electronic systems. To be sure of supply and quality, Airbus makes its own. It’s an expensive commodity – a house-brick-sized crystal of space quality quartz is worth tens of thousands of pounds.About 80 miles west of Stevenage, and at the other end of the business scale, Chris visits Oxford Space Systems, whose CEO Sean Sutcliffe explains that while microsatellites are opening up the industry to more companies, they pose challenges of their own because of their size. These satellites have tiny spaces on the rockets that launch them, but need quite sizeable antennas and receivers to communicate with people and machines on earth. This is OSS’s business – to provide novel engineering solutions in packing up and unfurling these structures. They combine the latest materials science with knitting and origami to produce antennas that extend to hundreds of times their packed length and receivers that unfurl like beautiful hi-tech flowers. Of course, all spacecraft need rigorous testing before deployment. Maggie visits RAL-Space, who provide these services. She discovers that not only the conditions of space must be replicated in huge vacuum chambers, but that the experience of being launched must also be gone through. This means being shaken on a vibration table that can be programmed to replicate the precise vibration profile of the launch rocket and being shocked to simulate the firing of the explosive bolts that separates the spacecraft from the rocket. This is done by attaching critical components to a steel plate that then has a steel projectile fired at the plate’s opposite side.So far, so good. But the success of the satellite has brought with it a huge problem. Dead and broken satellites are clogging up the available orbits and could makes things even worse if anything crashes into them. Chris visits multinational Japanese company Astroscale who have come up with a solution in the form of another satellite, controlled from their mission control in the UK. Their spacecraft – ELSA-d – is a proof of concept for a satellite retirement service, which it is hoped could clean up the dangerously cluttered low earth orbitsPete Lawrence is on hand to tell us about the surreally beautiful phenomenon of noctilucent clouds, ice crystals in the upper atmosphere lit by the sun from beyond the horizon. The effect has become more common in recent years, because of the increase in rocket launches, which leave water in their wake as they leave the Earth.Finally, Maggie shows Chris the final piece of evidence that Britain’s space industry is going from strength to strength, when they visit the new National Satellite Test Facility. This purpose-built, awe-inspiring, cathedral-sized building is capable of comprehensively testing the largest satellites from the UK and abroad. It houses a 20m-long vacuum chamber with a 7m diameter, the country’s largest faraday cage and vibration tables large enough to test whole spacecraft. And a scoop for the Sky at Night: it’s the first time that TV cameras have been allowed into the facility, which is scheduled to open in the second half of 2021."

Two other families are also plunged into the most ethically difficult decision in modern medicine.This documentary is part of Louis Theroux: Docs That Made Me, a collection of his favourite documentaries. Many documentaries, Louis suggests, could do with losing a few minutes here and there. He makes an exception for Between Life and Death though, which doesn't waste a second with its economical storytelling. The day to day events which take place in hospitals have the potential to be highly emotional and full of drama.

But one young resident is questioning her future.","In one picturesque village in Sussex, life is very different. There’s no crime, debt or homelessness, everyone has a job but no-one earns a wage, and none of the children watch television, use social media, play video games or have a mobile phone. With unique access to this historically private community, this film enters the remarkable village of Darvell, where for almost 50 years an extraordinary radical Christian community, the Bruderhof, has lived outside mainstream society. The film holds a mirror up to modern Britain, with its consumerist concerns, high crime and deprivation rates, and looks at this community's simple way of life, while also exploring the personal costs and sacrifices required to live there. Hannah, Bernard and Hardy are part of the 300-strong village of brothers and sisters living as disciples of Jesus. Bernard, his wife Rachel and their three children live a ‘back to basics’ lifestyle in a shared house with several other families, including Bernard’s parents. Most of their meals are taken with the other residents in a large communal dining room where they eat, sing and worship together.Outgoing and inquisitive, Hannah is questioning this way of life. At 18, she wants to experience life outside the community she was born into before making a lifelong commitment. The film follows her extraordinary journey as she leaves her family and the familiarity of this closeted community behind, and makes her way to the big city – London. But whilst Hannah experiences the independence of her first paid job, she also begins to question both the Bruderhof way of life and her experiences in mainstream society.As a teenager, Hardy became acutely aware of the sacrifices members of the Bruderhof have to make. Together with his five siblings, herebelled against the ideals of the community, and with their blessing, his family left the Bruderhof and began a new life outside. Hardy has since returned to the community, accepting that a life there is one of sacrifice – not only surrendering all possessions and money, but something greater: giving up personal ambition and the freedom to make his own decisions. Whilst Hardy and Bernard are happy to make this commitment for a greater cause, will the fresh opportunities that Hannah is discovering in the city tempt her away?This programme has been edited since broadcast. The original transmission featured an end card, now removed, stating that some former members of the Bruderhof made allegations against the community regarding their treatment whilst living there."

If Emma believed everything she read in the media, then she’d conclude that, as a plus-size girl, she was simply too big for romance. Not only are there almost no positive role models for “big love” in popular culture, often there is actual hate. Emma is introduced to the extraordinary Athena May, a self-styled “goddess of love”, who performs a masterclass in plus-size sex at an “erotic emporium” in east London.

Charges of betrayal both of the RUC as a force and of the hundreds of former officers who had been killed in the Troubles marked its inception.

Sir Chris Patten outlines the political context, and Sir Ronnie Flanaghan, the last chief constable of the RUC and the first chief constable of the PSNI, gives a first hand account about the transition.

In 2014, 22-year-old Elliot Rodger shot and stabbed six of his fellow students to death in a premeditated attack at the University of California, Santa Barbara. His motive? In a chilling video Rodger said he was angry that he was still a virgin and in his words wanted to show himself as 'the true alpha male' by punishing women for not being attracted to him. The legacy of Rodger's assault catapulted online incels into wider consciousness. Incels - short for 'involuntary celibates' - are a global community of sexually frustrated young men, who have found support amongst one another on the net. Some idolise Rodger, and chillingly, his murder spree seems to have helped inspire at least three further mass killings in North America, that have mainly targeted women.   At its extreme, incel ideology spreads violent misogyny, which blames women for depriving men of sex and relationships. Some forums have recorded up to 40,000 members and feature depraved ideas like state-sponsored rape and girlfriends.  Following eight months of unprecedented access to incels, this documentary is the deepest exploration yet of this notoriously closed community.  Told primarily through the personal stories of three men who identify as incels, the documentary explores how an online ideology can push young men into very disturbing behaviour. But the film also delves behind the sensationalist media headlines to unearth some of the reasons for incels' existence - many feel alienated and are enduring difficulties, like mental health issues, autism or traumatic upbringing.  For some, the online forums are a haven to joke, vent and find support in a world where they are struggling to find an identity and where gender relations are changing dramatically. The question is, where are the lines between this radical misogyny and violence?"

At the heart of that conviction was QAnon.In 2020, the BBC's Stephanie Hegarty reported on the dramatic rise of this vast conspiracy during the pandemic. A year on from the attack on the Capitol, she has travelled to the US to meet some of those who still believe in the conspiracy.

Linda Adey is investigating what happens when a date goes wrong and you want to report sexual assault to a dating app.,"While dating apps like Tinder, Bumble and Hinge now play a major role in many young Brits' love lives, a rising number of sexual assault cases have also been reported which happened after meeting someone on an app. Reporter Linda Adey investigates the safety of the most popular dating apps in Britain. She asks whether providing background checks for all users might be one way to improve safety on the most popular apps.  Linda also explores the complaints processes of dating apps. She meets 26-year-old Bex, who tried to report her Tinder date, who she claims sexually assaulted her during a date. She ended up being banned by Tinder, who took months to respond to her initial complaint. According to a survey carried out for the BBC, 47% of people who responded and had used a dating app were not happy with the way their complaint was handled. Linda Adey meets a young woman, Sasha, who claims she was raped twice after meeting a date. Sasha couldn't report the incident because her Tinder date blocked her, which meant all records of their connection on the app were deleted. According to a new survey carried out for the BBC, 33% of dating app users who responded have experienced either harassment or abuse by someone they met via a dating app. The survey includes women and men aged 18-35 years old.The investigation also looks into the latest police data. More than 6,000 people have reported offences linked to dating apps between 2017 and 2021. One in five were sexual offences. The police data is supported by the National Crime Agency's latest statistics from March 2021. They found that cases have increased over the past four years, and 83% of the victims were female. But the true number of cases could be higher: according to the Office for National Statistics, fewer than 16% of sexual assaults are reported to the police.  In very rare cases, a date ends tragically. Linda Adey meets the mum of 26-year-old Katherine from Wales. After Katherine met her new partner on Plenty of Fish, she was stabbed 33 times by someone who turned out to be a dangerous and violent offender. How could someone with over 140 previous convictions be a user of a dating app?"

A proud Englishman, Jack applied for only one job in his subsequent career as a football manager: the England job. Jack never received a reply from the FA. Instead, he accepted an invitation to manage the Republic of Ireland, and took on a side that had never qualified for a major tournament to the dizzying heights of a World Cup quarter-final.In doing so he inspired a nation. Ireland’s footballing success represented far more than winning matches, it influenced a social and cultural change in a country that faced deep-seated political and economic challenges.Finding Jack Charlton tells the story of Jack’s special association with Ireland and also examines his frustration with England and the FA, his complicated relationship with his brother Sir Bobby Charlton, and his final battle with dementia.Offering an intimate, compelling insight into Jack the man, Finding Jack Charlton includes contributions from Jack’s family, his wife Pat and son John, alongside celebrated Irish players, musicians, writers and politicians, including Larry Mullen Jr, Roddy Doyle, Brendan O’Carroll, Paul McGrath, Niall Quinn, Mick McCarthy, David O’Leary and Andy Townsend."

On 9 October 1986, nine-year-old friends Karen Hadaway and Nicola Fellows went out to play and didn't come home. The whole estate turned out to look for the two girls only to have their hopes dashed when they were found lying dead in undergrowth in Wild Park, on the outskirts of Brighton. Both had been strangled and sexually assaulted.For their families it was the start of a living hell. Police arrested a man the girls liked and trusted - 20-year-old Russell Bishop - and in 1987 he was put on trial. But the jury took less than two hours to acquit him of the murders. Under the law at the time, Bishop could not be retried even if new evidence were to be found. The families of the murdered girls had to endure years of agony, without any prospect of justice for their lost children. Until 2005, when the double jeopardy law was abolished, rekindling the hopes of the families.Now police and scientists are using cutting-edge methods to uncover new evidence, which they hope will be enough for the CPS to pursue a fresh prosecution. Following the reinvestigation and proceedings from an early stage, and sharing the experience of the children's families, this film charts the last chance at finally finding justice for Karen and Nicola."

David Olusoga exposes the secret files behind the Windrush scandal.,"David Olusoga opens secret government files to show how the Windrush scandal and the ‘hostile environment’ for black British immigrants has been 70 years in the making. The film features Sarah O’Connor, Anthony Bryan and Judy Griffith. Settled here legally since childhood, they were re-classified as illegal immigrants by new ‘hostile environment’ regulations. Unable to show proof of their nationality status, they lost jobs, savings and their health, facing deportation back to countries they could barely remember. David reveals how today’s scandal is rooted in the secrets of the past. The first Windrush generation were Commonwealth citizens - many of them ex-servicemen - coming to rebuild war-torn Britain. Yet even before arriving, they were viewed by the government with hostility. Civil servants and MPs warned of dire consequences if what they called a ‘coloured element’ was introduced into the UK. PM Clement Attlee even suggested diverting the Windrush passengers to east Africa - to pick peanuts. The same government was actively recruiting tens of thousands of white volunteer workers from Europe - some of them former members of Waffen-SS regiments which stood accused of war crimes on the Eastern Front - for ‘permanent settlement here with a view to their inter-marrying and complete absorption into our own working population’. The files expose how successive British governments spent the next decade trying to devise a way to prevent further Caribbean arrivals without appearing to discriminate against them. PM Winston Churchill, dissatisfied with ministers’ response to what he saw as a serious problem, kept the issue on the cabinet agenda and a special Working Party was set up to gather information to make the political case for immigration controls. Two weeks after the Queen’s coronation as head of the UK and Commonwealth, a secret race survey was undertaken and completed, looking for proof that Commonwealth immigrants were a burden on the welfare state. Chief constables in major cities were asked if ‘the coloured community as a whole, or particular sections of it, are generally idle or poor workmen’, and if they were ‘addicted to drug-trafficking or other types of crime’. The Working Party found no evidence for the view that the ‘coloured community’ was less law-abiding or hard working than other Brits.  When Harold Macmillan’s government introduced the 1962 Immigration Act, its control mechanism was the employment prospects of would-be immigrants. The files show how home secretary ‘Rab’ Butler, described the ‘great merit’ of the scheme was that it ‘can be presented as making no distinction on grounds of race or colour’, but would, in practice, ‘operate on coloured people almost exclusively’. By that time, Caribbean immigration had shrunk to a fraction of earlier levels. But, fearing further restrictions, the Windrush generation now arranged for their children to come. The ‘children of the Windrush' had full legal rights to join their parents in the UK, and many arrived with little paperwork or official record keeping.  Successive governments passed new immigration and nationality legislation, often in response to perceived ‘problems’ or ‘crises’. Harold Wilson rushed through the 1968 Immigration Act, in just three days to stop arrivals of thousands of passport-holding British-Indians living in Kenya, whose businesses and livelihoods were threatened by its government. Edward Heath’s 1971 Act tried to restrict the legal definition of ‘Britishness’. It also placed the burden of proof on the claimant should their Britishness be challenged - a fateful clause for the ‘children of the Windrush’.  Throughout the multiple changes to immigration and nationality law enacted up to 2014, the nationality status of the ‘children of Windrush’ remained unchanged and unchallenged. As British citizens with full legal rights to live here, they put down roots, pursued careers, raised children and grandchildren and contributed in ways great and small to the creation of modern Britain. But with the introduction of the so-called ‘hostile environment’ legislation of 2014 and 2016, their situation changed. Though they were never the intended targets of the new laws, the hostile environment machine that evolved over the decade wasn’t designed to make allowances. Suddenly required to prove their status (due to the 1971 Act), Sarah, Anthony and Judy found themselves unable to show the levels of proof demanded by the new ‘hostile environment’ regulations. All three lost their jobs for up to two years and ran up debt trying to make ends meet. Anthony was arrested twice by Immigration Officers and held for weeks in detention centres. Then a ticket was bought to deport him to Jamaica, a country hadn’t seen since he left, aged eight, in 1965. ‘They broke me in there,’ Anthony says. ‘It was hard.’ Judy Griffith, still struggling to repay her debts, says: ‘It makes you question the whole, what is British? What is Britishness?’"

The film follows his efforts over the summer to secure a deal with the European Union, who had previously refused to reopen the withdrawal agreement.

A cross-party group of MPs work together to form a 'remain alliance' and pass legislation that requires Boris Johnson to ask for a Brexit extension, and the Labour party ultimately decides to vote to allow a general election to take place. Throughout these events, MPs from all sides of the argument reveal their candid thoughts on the strategies they are pursuing and the pressures they face from an increasingly frustrated and divided electorate.  As the story unfolds, Laura gives her unique insight into what is really going on behind closed doors, and explains how the political decisions will mean lasting implications for the future of the political parties and the lives of those they represent."

This is the first documentary to examine the app’s effects on users since whistleblower Frances Haugen disclosed internal company research proving Facebook, now known as Meta, was aware of Instagram’s role in exacerbating issues around body image and self-harm for younger users. Meta says the research shows the majority of its users have a positive experience on the platform.Haugen and a number of former Instagram and Facebook insiders, many speaking on camera for the first time, speak candidly about life inside the company. They reveal details of pivotal moments, such as Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram in 2012, and explain how these decisions shaped Instagram and its values. The power of the platform is also explored through revealing testimonies from three British users: Lauren, Chenade and Abby. With unflinching honesty, they describe how their lives have been impacted by the app. Lauren was on Instagram for 13 hours per day and found herself increasingly struggling with an eating disorder. Chenade decided to get a Brazilian butt lift, one of the most dangerous cosmetic surgeries in the world, and promote it to her Instagram followers, only to regret her decision soon after. Meanwhile, home-schooled Abby turned to Instagram for solace and found herself sucked into anti-recovery communities who promote self-harm."

The brainchild of Jerry Dammers saw dance music with a message dominate the charts from 1979.","Using music, archive and new interviews this is the story of 2 Tone – a unique musical phenomenon that exploded out of Coventry in the summer of 1979.  2 Tone not only dominated the charts and got the nation dancing to a ska beat, it played a vital part in the movement against racism in Britain and beyond. Including a rare interview with Jerry Dammers, the architect of 2 Tone, and contributions from other key players, the film explores the music style and ethos of the genre, and charts the remarkable story of how this independent ‘do it yourself’ record label from Coventry, went on to have a global impact and a unique place in popular music. 2 Tone’s distinctive look and sound, heavily influenced by 1960s Jamaica, was the brainchild of Jerry Dammers, founder and keyboard player of The Specials. Along with fellow Coventry band The Selecter, The Specials spearheaded 2 Tone from their hometown. The record label also went on to launch the careers of other bands too including Madness and The Beat. Jerry Dammers reveals how he came up with the ideas behind the 2 Tone revolution. Calling for unity at a time of growing racial tension in the UK, this was music with a message, featuring multiracial bands. With the unlikely blend of Jamaican ska and punk rock, the film explores how a brand-new musical genre came seemingly out of nowhere and went mainstream overnight as legions of fans adopted the rude boy/girl  image and propelled the bands up the charts. It also considers why Coventry was the perfect place for the movement to begin. But it wasn’t just about the message – it was about fun, and live gigs renowned for their energy. The last 2 Tone release, ‘Nelson Mandela’ by The Special AKA  saw Jerry Dammers'  anti-racist message go onto a global stage and was in his words, ‘the culmination of 2 Tone’. The film also hears from Jerry’s bandmate in The Specials, Neville Staple  Pauline Black and Neol Davies of The Selecter, proud Coventrian and one time Special’s manager Pete Waterman and 2 Tone fan and film director Gurinder Chadha. Recalling significant rehearsals, gigs and photoshoots, Neville Staple and Neol Davies reminisce together in the original Coventry locations which have long since changed use The Locarno, one-time hub of Coventry nightlife and scene of raucous gigs is now the Central Library. 2 Tone is being celebrated in Coventry as part of Coventry UK City of Culture 2021."

Bafta Award-winning film-maker Louis Theroux returns to the UK to meet women legally providing sexual services, either to make a living or to supplement their income, potentially earning hundreds of pounds per hour.

Yet there are those who feel that selling sex can be a valid, empowering choice for those who choose to engage in it.

Using his tweets and first-hand testimony from White House insiders, this documentary for BBC Three explores how the president of the United States came of age on Twitter and documents the impact of his tweets on politics in America and across the world.With unprecedented access to people in his inner circle and interviews with experts, journalists and some of his most avid Twitter followers, this documentary tells the story of how Trump weaponised Twitter and used it as a tool to shape policy, conduct diplomacy and wage war on the establishment.From Trump’s first innocuous tweet to his early celebrity beefs, from his feuds with politicians to the extraordinary exchanges with North Korea’s leader and his continuing war on anyone who opposes him, Trump uses Twitter to tell the world what he is thinking and doing at all times. The film explores how his tweets provide an insight into his psyche and help maintain his cult-like popularity amongst his followers. And in light of the recent events and protests across the US (and the rest of the world), the programme asks whether his tweets are a threat to democracy or the mark of a president who has revolutionised the way leaders communicate with their people.Trump in Tweets features interviews with, to mention but a few, Anthony Scaramucci, former White House director of communications, who reveals what it is like when the president turns his Twitter feed on you, Sean Spicer, Trump’s first presidential press secretary, who got caught between the president’s tweeting and the press, and Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal lawyer. The film also gains access to Peter Costanzo, who started Donald Trump’s Twitter account and wrote his first ever tweet, Sam Nunberg, former political consultant to Donald Trump, who was part of a team who helped Trump build a loyal following with a series of conservative tweets, including fuelling the conspiracy theory falsely claiming that Barack Obama had a fake birth certificate, Lauren Batchelder, who endured a sustained tirade of online abuse after she questioned Trump about his attitudes to women at a political event, and Emmy Bengtson, deputy social media director to the Hillary Clinton campaign, who wrote Hillary Clinton’s tweets during the ‘Delete Your Account’ Twitter battle between Clinton and Trump. Yeonmi Park, a North Korean defector, gives her perspective of Trump’s ‘Rocket Man’ tweets, which dramatically raised tensions in the Korean peninsula, and Bryson Gray, a Trump supporter, explains what happened to him after Trump tweeted to endorse one of his raps."

Her strength of character and her strong faith have been tested repeatedly since her family was rocked by tragedy in 2012, when her father Noel and brothers Graham and Nevin died in a single, devastating incident on their farm. This programme looks at how Emma has tried to cope with such a traumatic loss and what impact it has had on her art, as well as revealing the family’s story since then. Nevin was well known as a professional rugby player with Ulster, and Emma reflects on how their similar outgoing personalities and careers in the public eye were at odds with the traditions of their close-knit and private rural family. Emma explores how her work conveys the juxtaposition between traditional pastoral landscapes and the realities of farming the land as seen through the eyes of those who live and work on it. She reflects on resilience and surviving loss and considers wider themes such as how grief and trauma can be reflected in and processed through making art."

As reports of sexual violence have dramatically increased in recent years, the government has urged US colleges to enforce a stricter code of sexual conduct amongst students. Employing specialist administrators to carry out investigations into alleged misdemeanors, they now have the power to permanently exclude those they deem ‘responsible’. For the victims of sexual assault these new processes, which require less stringent levels of proof than criminal cases, have allowed accusations that might have never been heard in a court of law to be vindicated.  But alleged perpetrators believe the attempt to be more vigilant about rape and assault has turned into an overreaction that tramples on due process, and harms innocent people. At the start of this journey, Louis meets a neuroscience major called Saif Khan, who has been accused of raping a fellow student. His university is investigating the claims separately even though Saif has been found not-guilty in a court of law. Though Saif continuously pleads his innocence, Louis is drawn into an increasingly complex world, where separating fact from fiction becomes increasingly challenging. He also meets young women whose claims of sexual assault have previously fallen on deaf ears, who believe that a new approach to handling allegations of sex crimes is not only necessary but long overdue. One such student is Mollie Johnson, whose experience is a powerful reminder that there is now a broader understanding of what sexual assault looks like."

But when it comes to deciding careers, are algorithms really fit for the job? This film unpacks concerns around bias and inaccuracy in algorithm-based hiring.","If you’re applying for a job today, your application could go through several stages before it is seen by a human. BBC journalist and former recruiter Daniel Henry deep dives into this new world of algorithm and computer-automated hiring. Daniel’s journey begins at the first stage of a job application – writing your CV. At the University of Liverpool, he is given tips from their student career advisors about how best to tailor his CV so it isn’t rejected by software used to select applicants to progress to the next stage. Stage two is often a video interview, which again could be marked automatically on the basis of a computer programme searching for key words.In a series of exclusive interviews, Daniel reveals the story of three former employees of Mac Makeup who lost their jobs in part due to a video interview, which used facial analysis technology. Disgusted that their interviews were not even reviewed by a real person, these women took legal action against Estee Lauder, eventually reaching an agreement outside of court. Hirevue, whose platform was used in this redundancy process, defend their platform against any accusation of bias. They have since dropped the facial analysis technology from their products.With the roll out of AI hiring speeding up, Daniel is keen to look at the accuracy of technology that might be used by companies. With the help of academics, he discovers how race, gender and emotion can be misinterpreted by some facial analysis technology, and he finds out that voice transcription services still struggle with accuracy when faced with regional UK accents. Finally, Daniel meets Ollie, who is autistic and has ADHD. He has struggled to find a graduate job for two years. Nat of the Exceptional Individuals Agency, which supports neuro-divergent people in the workplace, finds his story sadly unsurprising.Daniel looks at whether game-play or puzzle-based online tests set by some employers might help, but the truth is what works for one individual might not work for another. The film ends with some solid advice on how to make sure you are ready for the job hunt in a world which is fast becoming dominated by tech. And if you’re certain that the computer has it wrong, for reasons that aren’t fair, then you ought to call it out. No technology is perfect, and what is affecting you today, could be affecting far more of us down the line if left unchecked."

To find the answer, Tom returned to California in 2018 to investigate. Tom meets those who have survived similar hair-raising encounters and the experts who know the whales best. What he discovers raises far bigger questions, not just about what happened that day but also about our relationship with whales and their future alongside us."

From bars where men pay to meet schoolgirls to suggestive pictures of very young children and comic books featuring child rape, the country has faced global criticism for its attitudes. It was only three years ago that possessing genuine child pornography was finally made illegal. Stacey travels to Tokyo to look into what effect the law banning child porn has had and to see if the attitude towards the sexualisation of children has changed. Stacey discovers a culture where sexual images of young girls are widespread and used for commercial gain. Her first stop is a legal Tokyo 'JK' cafe in which school-aged girls are paid to provide company to older men - who tell her that it is perfectly normal to talk about sex and hold hands with girls as young as 15 dressed in school uniform. Stacey uncovers an even more disturbing legal grey area exists in Japan called Chako Ero, where children as young as six are filmed or photographed in erotic clothing. She speaks to a producer of these films as well as a self-confessed paedophile to try and discover just why some Japanese culture seems to encourage inappropriate exploitation and sexualisation of children. Following the law change, the documentary examines what else Japan is doing to stop normalising the sexualisation of children. Stacey meets volunteers from a charity trying to help vulnerable girls, as well as the Head of the Juvenile Section at the National Police to find what they are doing to protect young girls."

In 1976, Caitlyn – then known as Bruce – won Decathlon gold at the Montreal Olympics. She was called 'the world's greatest athlete'. Fame and adulation followed, but gender dysphoria – where there's a mismatch between someone's biological sex and their gender identity – was always bubbling away under the surface. In 2015, Caitlyn finally came out as a transgender woman. In this programme, Simon Mundie and Caitlyn discuss some of the lessons she has learnt during her incredible life. They talk about the importance of honesty and being true to yourself and your family around you, and about not judging a book by its cover, as someone who apparently has it all may well be suffering inside. It’s all about the challenges you overcome, not the heights you attain.

London – the crowning example of the uniquely British inner city mash up of race, class and culture – has been the crucible for a series of original and unique music genres and pop culture lifestyles that have set the world alight. The recipe has been further enriched by contributions from other key urban centres – cities like Bristol and Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. Inspired by the bass heavy rhythms of Jamaican sound systems, fused with the culture, fashion, slang and attitude of the Caribbean, West Africa, Asia and America, fueled by a never-ending soundtrack of pirate radio, and led by successive generations of entrepreneurs, hustlers and maverick visionaries, the whole world has moved to the beats of underground music and club culture made right here, in Britain.  This is the story of Jungle, UKG and Grime – three massive underground music scene that were all ‘Made in Britain.’ These more recent genres exploded from the streets, pirate radio stations and council estates of London and the UK’s inner cities over a period of just a few years in the 1990s. All three gave birth to their own unique sounds, creating a generation of stars, fashions, club scenes and fortunes and all three never quite vanished. Their beats, flows and attitude can still be heard in tunes being made today.  Each episode gives the inside track one of the genres, as told by some of the leading figures who created these underground movements in the first place, in conversation with Ron Samuels, himself a leading light of the original 90s Jungle scene as DJ Ron, and now a documentary director."

This show charts George’s own story of education – his evolution from Grime MC to Cambridge student to spoken word artist – and pays homage to the rap music that shaped him and his peers. George brings a number of friends to the stage to explore what rap can teach us about education."

Made by award-winning documentary maker Olly Lambert, One Day in Gaza examines, moment by moment, what happened on that fateful day. 14 May 2018 started as a day of mass protest at Gaza’s border with Israel, and would end as one of the most deadly days in Gaza for a generation. For weeks, Palestinians had been protesting along the border fence, but tensions were running particularly high due to the opening of the new United States embassy to Israel in Jerusalem - the controversial step ordered by Donald Trump. As Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner and other senior US officials gathered in Jerusalem to inaugurate the new embassy, tens of thousands of Palestinians gathered at sites along the Gaza border, barely 40 miles away. As the sun set that day, over 60 Palestinians were dead or dying, and over two thousand lay injured, many by live ammunition.  Drawing on more than 120 hours of archive footage filmed on both sides of the border that day - including exclusive videos released by both Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that dominates Gaza, and the Israel Defense Forces, this film reveals the complex reality and human toll of the day, and asks who is to blame for the bloodshed. It also features exclusive interviews with senior commanders and intelligence officers from the Israel Defense Forces, as well as political leaders of both Hamas and Islamic Jihad, another militant group, and civilians who were present on both sides of the border. What really happened that day? Israel said its troops only opened fire in self-defence or on people using the protests as cover for an armed infiltration, while Palestinians and human rights groups have accused Israeli troops of using excessive force against unarmed civilians who posed no threat. This 60-minute film reveals extraordinary new details of what happened."

This phenomenon has been growing quietly for the past three years, but is now creeping into the mainstream. Reporter Ellie Flynn investigates how thousands of ordinary people and teenagers all across the world are making money from selling their own nude photos and videos.But how many people creating content for these sites are actually underage, and should the sites themselves be doing more to protect underage and vulnerable contributors? Ellie meets Hannah, a 17-year-old from Scotland, who has been selling explicit content of herself since she was 16. Hannah set up an account on a site called OnlyFans using a fake ID. She was reported for being under 18 and kicked off the site but managed to set up a new profile and continue selling nudes. Lauren, 23, is one of the top-ranked Only Fans creators in the world. She has over 2,000 subscribers and over 400,000 followers on Instagram. In one month alone, Lauren earned a jaw-dropping £37,000 - a figure she says is going up every month.  But not everyone is making a decent living. Some vulnerable people find themselves using sites like these to help put a roof over their heads. Sasha is 20 and earns a few hundred pounds a month on OnlyFans. She uses sex toys, collaborates with other performers and has even had requests to make videos of herself going to the toilet for £50-£60. Sasha has a history of mental health issues and turns to the local council to help her find suitable accommodation when she decides to leave home.

This is their story of surviving Helmand.At the height of the war in 2009 and 2010, the biggest threat to the soldiers were Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) – increasingly sophisticated and devastating homemade bombs planted by the Taliban. Activated by pressure from above or a command wire, they became the single largest cause of fatalities and injuries, and an effective psychological terror weapon. Geraint (Gez) Jones from Wrexham joined the Royal Welsh Regiment looking for adventure. But this was not what he had signed up for. The IEDs were hard to detect and a constant threat. Gez saw what they could do to soldiers and their families. When the war was over, he felt like a failure and started drinking and using drugs. Geraint recovered after he left the army, focusing on physical exercise and his love of the outdoors, wrote a best-selling book based on his experiences and has forged a successful career as a podcaster and writer of historical fiction.Steve Owen from Cardigan was another who signed up looking for adventure. But in 2010, Steve’s Jackal vehicle hit an IED. He ended up having his leg amputated as a result of chronic pain from his injuries. This would be the beginning of a new life for Steve and his family. Just four months after his amputation, Steve succeeded in completing a 26-mile sponsored walk. Now with three children and a happy marriage, he is embarking on an even more ambitious marathon to raise funds for Woody’s Lodge, a charity that supports veterans of the armed forces and emergency services, where he works as project manager.Most challenging of all for families back home was the loss of a loved one. Sarah Adams from Cwmbran was proud when her young son James Prosser joined the army. James drove a Warrior Infantry Fighting Vehicle at the height of the IED attacks, and in September 2009, the news that Sarah feared most arrived one morning. An IED had blown up the Warrior James was driving, and he had died from his injuries. With the war still raging, James's mother felt she needed to go to Camp Bastion, where James had died, to get some resolution of her grief. Sarah flew to Camp Bastion in June 2012, three years after her son’s death there.Hugh Keir from the village of Crynant near Neath was a sniper in the 3rd Battalion Parachute Regiment. He was trapped in the siege of Musa Qala and at the mercy of daily Taliban bombardments. Like many veterans, it took years for Hugh to get help for the deep psychological impact of his experiences. As part of his recovery, Hugh started a podcast and a rugby team - the FuBars - to help others."

Narrated by Alec Baldwin.,"Flint is the birthplace of General Motors and was once one of the most prosperous cities in the world. However, in the 1980s, the automobile industry in Flint collapsed, costing thousands of jobs and beginning a grim economic decline.Against this backdrop, Rick Snyder rose to power on a promise to run government like a business. As Michigan’s governor, he stripped Flint’s city council of its power, and his administrators raised water prices to balance the books. They then forced the city to use water from the Flint River in order to save more money. Almost immediately, it became clear something was wrong. In many homes the water turned brown, with residents reporting an increase in illness and rashes. At the last remaining General Motors assembly plant in Flint, car parts began to rust.Despite growing protests, the government insisted the water was perfectly safe. When Scotland-based film-maker Anthony Baxter arrived on the scene, he found Flint residents taking matters into their own hands, pulling together in a remarkable community effort to get at the truth. Hundreds of volunteers took part in a city-wide testing of Flint’s water. Rock band promoter and mother of three Melissa Mays helped lead the effort in partnership with decorated scientist Marc Edwards. Professor Edwards concluded that Flint was the site of a man-made health disaster. Because state officials didn’t treat the river water properly to prevent corrosion, it had eaten away at Flint’s old lead pipes, unleashing lead particles through the drinking water supply. For more than a year, lead had been finding its way into the bloodstreams of more than 10,000 of the city's children.Narrated by Alec Baldwin, this documentary explores the untold story of the man-made disaster that continues to haunt America to this day."

For a long time, the victims’ voices had remained unheard, but when widespread allegations of sexual abuse resurfaced in the late 2000s, Jersey’s then health minister Stuart Syvret spoke out about the scale of this historic child abuse and the damage done to the victims. Syvret’s words sparked a moment of reckoning for the small community, whose leaders were determined to protect the island’s reputation, home to a trillion dollars in offshore investment. This discreet offshore tax haven found itself in the middle of a major police investigation as the world’s media descended on the island, creating a media circus.

Because Afghanistan is the place that has confronted our politicians with the terrible truth - that they cannot understand what is going on any longer. The film reveals the forces that over the past thirty years rose up and undermined the confidence of politics to understand the world. And it shows the strange, dark role that Saudi Arabia has played in this.But Bitter Lake is also experimental. Curtis has taken the unedited rushes of everything that the BBC has ever shot in Afghanistan - and used them in new and radical ways.

He is intent on making a success of his music career, but that’s not straightforward.","Twenty-year-old Digga D is one of the biggest up-and-coming drill artists in the UK. He’s on the brink of stardom, with his singles getting millions of views online. But he has also been jailed for violent disorder. This film follows him as he is released from a 15-month stint in prison, at a pivotal moment in his life. He is intent on making a success of his music career, but that’s not straightforward.Digga D is one of the first musicians in British history to be given a criminal behaviour order that controls his creative output. It means he is not allowed to release any music, or videos, without telling the police. If the music breaches the terms of his CBO – for example 'inciting or encouraging violence', they can take it down and arrest him.The police say they target drill because it promotes and causes violence, but the genre’s supporters call this censorship and say that the art simply reflects real life. Digga’s situation, and his ongoing story, embodies this dilemma. His next moves could redefine his life, and his music, forever. A year after his social media accounts stopped, a year after his last music video, his last post and his last tweet, Digga is coming back. This film tells the story of how he manages that, and who is helping him. His lawyer Cecilia has been defending him for years. She is doing all she can to enable him to make music, despite his restrictions. But with his music so rigorously policed, can he do that and secure his future?Digga has everything to fight for – and everything to lose."

He investigates the complex worlds of these three dog breeds, explores why there is a boom in people buying and breeding ‘popular’ dogs, questions whether it is causing an animal welfare crisis and asks what can be done to help alleviate the problems?   Fabian has witnessed the puppy boom first-hand through his work at a small animal's veterinary practice in Birmingham. The huge increase in the numbers of people wanting to buy a puppy has resulted in prices going up, which in turn has led to more people breeding dogs and has boosted the relatively new canine fertility industry, with a proliferation of canine fertility clinics offering artificial insemination services for dogs and new training courses that teach people how to do artificial insemination themselves.  Fabian explores the huge price tags for some puppies and what draws people to these popular breeds, unpacks some of the hereditary health and welfare issues the breeds face, and he hears from the Dogs Trust that many puppies bought online are being illegally imported to the UK, requiring tighter regulations needed to improve the situation. Fabian also meets some prospective owners, introducing them to the RSPCA so they can find out the best practice when it comes to buying a new puppy. He also speaks to the RSPCA about the growing problem of dogs having their ears cropped, which has become popular with bully breeds, and highlights how barbaric and damaging this practice is.  To explore the rise in new breeders, Fabian hears from owners about their experiences of breeding their own dogs and the challenges and costs they have faced. He also meets people who have recently opened their own canine fertility clinics and hears concerns about what is being taught on one training course. He also uncovers evidence of worrying, illegal techniques being taught to amateurs on a canine fertility course. After showing footage to a veterinary expert in dog breeding, Fabian takes his findings to the government's chief veterinary officer, Christine Middlemiss, to discuss what happens next and whether more regulation is needed.Fabian ends the documentary by revealing how the journey of the young couple wanting to buy a dog has concluded and by offering his insight into what can be done to improve the welfare of the nation’s favourite pet."

Stone skimming is an activity with competitive nature at its core, but little is known of the esoteric world of competition skimming and the devoted individuals who call themselves the ‘Elite’.With the coveted title of World Champion and the first ever Guinness world record up for grabs, Sink or Skim delves deep into what it takes to be 'Top Tosser' in the biggest year in the history of the sport.The sport is at a crucial apex, it’s future hangs in balance. A point where enough people are getting involved that questions are being raised about what direction the sport should move towards. This can be neatly split into two camps: people who think Easdale is the irrefutable spiritual home of the sport and should never move, and those who think it’s 63m quarry is a limiting length for throwers and a hindrance to stone skimmings’ potential.There are murmurs and aspirations of it being accepted into the Olympics or Commonwealth games, and that may never happen if the sport can’t leave Easdale, that being said, Easdale’s survival is dependant of the money raised on the World ChampIonship weekend.Alex Lewis and Dougie Isaacs, the two most capable competitors of hitting Easdales’ ‘Backwall’, hail from opposite sides of these camps. Dougie accepts the limitations of the island and demonstrates a zen attitude to competition, usually his zen comes from two pints of ale. Alex on the other had, only values one thing, and that’s winning. If doesn't get a competition that caters to the 100m-plus thrower he might just have to go a make one himself."

He digs deep into Joe's background, meets Carole Baskin and asks what made the Tiger King.","This 90-minute special sees Louis Theroux travel to America to investigate the story of a man who has become one of the most controversial and captivating icons of recent times: the gun-toting, self-described 'gay hillbilly' and 'Tiger King' Joe Exotic.A decade on from when he first met Joe for the documentary America’s Most Dangerous Pets, Louis returns to Oklahoma, responding to a direct call from Joe to tell the ‘real story’ and to explore the saga of an animal hoarder turned convicted felon. Joe now resides in a federal prison, having been found guilty of a murder-for-hire plot and multiple animal cruelty charges. But rather than living as a pariah, Joe is now a media phenomenon, the object of international obsession for pundits, celebrities and viewers, with a well-funded campaign team attempting to win him a presidential pardon.  Looking back at his original documentary, Louis reflects on hours of unseen footage and sets out to understand who the real Joe Exotic is and how he used his considerable charm and wiles to assemble a vast menagerie of animals and humans, all roped into a grand project of vanity and deception. Meeting old friends and family members of Joe’s, Louis picks apart the true crime story of how Joe came to be convicted. He also tells the story of Joe’s captivating charisma and the way in which it became a key ingredient in a viral television sensation, with life-changing consequences for all those involved - most of all Carole Baskin, originally the object of Joe’s vitriol, who found herself the target of his murder-for-hire plot and a mass trolling campaign. He digs deep into Joe’s family, unearthing the origin story of Joe’s pathology and laying bare an only-in-America saga that is part crime story, part media spectacle, part animal rights campaign but ultimately a 21st-century fable of a cowboy-cum-cult leader whose very fragility became a source of power - a power which, in some respects, persists to this day."

But she's on the hunt for the everyday heroes of the crisis. Stuck in her flat but armed with social media and a network of contacts, Stacey reaches out to people across the country in search of those who are trying to help others. In Wigan, there’s Charlotte, a teacher turned scrubs maker who is making protective equipment and has a backlog of orders to fill. She’s working 14-hour days for free, managing a team of 70 seamstresses, to provide desperately needed equipment to frontline service workers. Those on the front line include people like Serena and Richard, St John Ambulance volunteers who have joined thousands of others to help the health service manage the crisis. Stacey learns what's driving people to such selfless acts up and down the country. There’s also Elly, a mum to be who has suddenly found herself about to give birth in the middle of a global pandemic. These are crazy times, and Elly can’t quite believe the world she’s bringing her baby into. Being a new mum is hard at the best of times, but Elly is ready to take on the challenge. While Brits across the world struggled to get home, some chose to stay overseas and help others. Freya was one of them. She decided her charity work was more important than coming home to be with her mother, who is at risk. While people around the world are being urged to stay at home, she is working in Greece to help those who have been forced from their homes by a different but still deadly kind of crisis. The impact of the disease is taking its toll, but in Croydon, junior doctor Zainab is working to support those struggling with the challenges of lockdown, and those recovering from the shock of being in intensive care. She knew that the workload of a junior doctor can be intense, but she didn’t imagine it would be like this, testing her resilience beyond all expectation. Still, she is determined to rise to the challenge. Stacey gets in touch with Jonathan in Glasgow. He has hit the streets to support homeless people who were dependent on food handouts that have stopped since the city went into lockdown. In just a few weeks, countless volunteers have got together to provide food every night for the homeless. These people have no home to be safe inside, and now, more than ever, they are dependent on the self-sacrificing kindness of volunteers. Along the way, Stacey talks us through her lockdown at home in London - how she is keeping sane, and the difficulties of being stuck at home every day. But with every lockdown hero she finds, she becomes more in awe of mankind's ability to meet a crisis with determination, selflessness and compassion."

From 1962 until 1973, she worked at the BBC’s Radiophonic workshop, where she created the iconic Doctor Who theme tune, which remained uncredited in her lifetime.Delia Derbyshire introduced avant-garde electronic sound to a whole generation through the medium of a children’s teatime television show. Sound was both a refuge for Delia and a haunting manifestation of something darker. Delia was three years old during the Coventry blitz listening to the electronic sounds of the air-raid sirens against a backdrop of her devastated hometown. Delia describes the sound of the ‘all-clear' and air-raid sirens as her first experience of electronic music.This is a story where sound encapsulates the pain, violence and potential of modernity and positions Delia as tapping into a heightened realm, where her femininity and creativity are unshackled, amplified and set free. This essence in her music invites aggression and control, often unconsciously, from those around her. Her technical and creative brilliance, intuition and integrity is a threat that speaks to the devastating gender power politics of her age and which still persists today.Delia’s story is told through two archives: the first, a collection of lost works, 267 reels of quarter-inch magnetic tape recordings of Delia’s work found in her attic after her death, the other, her school books, paintings and keepsakes, discovered in her childhood bedroom.The combined archive, which now resides at Manchester's John Rylands library, is an incredible resource of unfiltered material. Delia’s poetic collages and atmospheric soundscapes reveal themselves as intriguing expressions of her extraordinary inner life. The drama begins with Delia Derbyshire as a time traveller and imagines a visitation where she brings with her fragments, objects and sounds from her past to bring her struggle and vision to life, finding solace in deeply personal soundscapes. Her struggle with alcoholism, frustrations at her contribution been downplayed in a predominantly male workplace as well as her intense artistic collaborations and life on the fringes of relationships are all explored in the film - all themes that collapse into sound, texture and harmonies. Delia is portrayed through a mix of observation and imagination. No single perspective would be sufficient to gain a true understanding of Delia. The docudrama replaces biography and a biopic style with something more lyrical.Its playful, psychedelic mix utilises archival materials, interviews with her collaborators and dramatisations while honouring the BBC Radiophonic Workshops arranger-composer's own questing spirit. This is a life story told through sound, using both Delia’s own pieces of music alongside a soundtrack constructed from samples chosen with musician and performance artist Cosey Fanni Tutti from Delia’s attic tapes. It explores the fantasy of a collaboration, an exchange of ideas across eras between two fascinating musicians. It celebrates independence and imagination and looks at how, when that energy is evoked by women and creates a spark, the pattern seen throughout history is that it is often dismissed, ridiculed or downplayed. A cinematic exploration of a legendary musical figure, written and directed by Caroline Catz, who also plays Delia."

Around half of all adults in the UK received two doses of it.But when Oxford scientists developed the jab, they had far greater ambitions: a 'vaccine for the world', designed specifically to be distributed to lower income countries and sold at cost for the duration of the pandemic. For both humanitarian and scientific reasons, they argued sharing vaccines fairly globally was the best way to bring coronavirus under control.A year later, more than 2.5 billion doses have been distributed worldwide. But with only one in 20 people in low income countries double jabbed and the Omicron variant spreading globally, how far did the vaccine meet its original purpose?Beset by challenges including supply disputes in Europe and, concerns over rare blood clots, the vaccine has never been approved in the US and is now barely used in the UK. So how much were these problems self-inflicted, or did nationalist politics get in the way?The BBC’s medical editor, Fergus Walsh, who has been reporting on the vaccine since its early development, examines the challenges this jab faced in Europe and beyond, and asks if it fulfilled the original hopes of the scientists in Oxford."

When Chris, who had suffered from testicular health scares in the past, appeared on live television to have a testicular examination, it made a huge impact. Chris’s aim was to raise awareness of testicular cancer and encourage men to check themselves. What he didn’t expect was the effect it would have closer to home.As a consequence of that appearance, and inspired by his brother for having 'had the balls' to do it, Chris’s older brother Ben checked himself for the first time, found a lump and was diagnosed with testicular cancer. Prior to an operation to have his testicle removed, Ben went to freeze his sperm for potential use after the operation. It was during this process that he discovered his sample didn’t contain any sperm at all.With both boys now concerned about their fertility, they embark on a journey to find out where they stand and what the future holds for them. Aside from their own medical stories, where Chris discovers how his fertility has changed since he was last tested six years earlier and Ben learns about his fertility prospects, the brothers meet a variety of people to explore the wider issues. Chris and Ben chat with their mates down the pub about how little men know about the causes of male infertility. They meet with one of the UK’s leading experts for a step-by-step guide to sperm, learn how infertility affects masculinity from a GB Olympic rower, and consider how their fertility struggles could impact on their family, and their girlfriends, in the long term."

Ellie Flynn travels to the USA to visit states poised to reconsider their child marriage laws. South Carolina is considering closing its 'marry-your-rapist' loophole that allows girls under 16 to marry if they are pregnant and have a parent’s consent. Visiting the record office in Spartanburg County, Ellie finds 16 child marriages in the county in the last decade. In ten of those cases, the groom could have been prosecuted under statutory rape laws. One of these marriages was between teenager Keri, then 15, and Paul, then 24. When Keri became pregnant, Paul agreed to marry her and help look after the baby in order to avoid prison. This raises a central question for Ellie: whose rights are more important: the underage, pregnant girl or the unborn, potentially fatherless baby? Ellie also travels to Georgia to meet 17-year-old Zion. She married at 16, and her groom David was just two years older than her, so Zion didn’t need to use the marry-your-rapist loophole, and nor was her groom at risk of prosecution for statutory rape. Many campaigners want to change Georgia’s minimum marriage age to 18, but Zion is convinced that this would have meant the end of her and David’s family, as they would have been forced to live apart for two years. But not all child marriages end in family harmony. Often it breaks families apart, as Ellie finds out in Idaho. Here, a case involving conflicting laws, religious beliefs and ideas of parental responsibility left two men in prison and a family at war. In Idaho, child marriage laws require a court order from a judge, but in the state of Missouri only the consent of one parent is needed. So when Heather became pregnant at 14, and without consulting her mother, Heather's father drove her across the USA to marry her 24-year-old rapist."

They don’t all agree on the motive, but they do agree there is much more to the murder of Nipsey Hussle than anyone is letting on."

Bridget Riley has been challenging our perception through painting for over 60 years, with radical work that has transformed how we look at art and invites us to feel with our eyes. With simple black and white geometric shapes, repeated curves of colour or an array of muted dots, Riley’s work moves, shimmers and - in some cases - unsettles. At the age of 90, Bridget Riley shows no signs of stopping. Her paintings command millions at auction, she has won prestigious awards and honours, and continues to innovate, paint, publish and exhibit around the world. BBC cameras have filmed with Riley over the past few years in two of her studios, on the cliffs of Cornwall, where she spent the Second World War, and at the National Gallery in London during the installation of her enormous mural there in 2018. In a rare and revealing interview with Kirsty Wark, Riley dispels the numerous misconceptions which have followed her throughout her career. Many consider her as a poster girl for the Swinging 60s, while others hail her as a titan of abstract art. However, Riley considers herself a traditional painter who has merely picked up the baton from those who have gone before her, such as Leonardo da Vinci, Monet, Cezanne and Matisse."

Louis Theroux is in Lagos, spending time with the local gangs, the so-called Area Boys, and the government's Kick Against Indiscipline paramilitary task force.","On the streets of Lagos, it is not the police who wield power but gangs of fight-hardened young men known as Area Boys. Louis spends time with several outfits, joining them as they patrol their turf, clash with local rivals and keep the peace in a brutal and haphazard fashion. The main income for the Area Boys is an arbitrary and unofficial form of taxation, extracted from local businesses and commercial drivers. Louis gets to know the rich and glamorous Area Boy leader MC, a former street youth himself, who has now become a friend of the most powerful men in the city. Taken under MC's wing, Louis experiences the top levels of the Area Boys' world from the inside, complete with a tour of MC's grand residence and extensive shoe collection, and ending in a chaotic mini-riot with gunshots, blood and mayhem. On the side of the law, Louis rides with KAI, the government's Kick Against Indiscipline paramilitary task force, as they storm different city districts. With bulldozers and arrest warrants, KAI use their own strong-arm tactics, and are in their way as feared as the Area Boys. In Law and Disorder in Lagos, Louis wrestles with life in a world in which the forces of law and the forces of disorder are not always readily distinguishable and nothing is quite what it seems."
Arena - Painted with My Hair,Documentaries,"BBC, iPlayer, TV, Arena, Painted with My Hair",How a remarkable US lifer survived years in solitary by turning M&Ms into art.,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p0b0vlrh.jpg,74 mins,4460,11pm 31 Oct 2021,How a remarkable US lifer survived years in solitary by turning M&M's into art.,How a US lifer survived long-term solitary confinement through a remarkable pen-pal friendship and the making of beautiful little paintings from M&M's.,"Painted with My Hair is inspired by the paintings, poetry and letters of Donny Johnson, an exceptionally intelligent and talented US lifer, who has been locked away inside his country’s notoriously punitive prison system since the age of 18. At 58, Donny was released from solitary and had his first parole board hearing in April 2018. But for 24 years of his prison life, he was ‘buried alive’ in an 11-by-seven-foot concrete cell inside the Super Max Security Housing Unit of Pelican Bay State Prison, where creativity and the making of art were crucial to Donny’s survival. Together with thousands of other long-time solitary confined prisoners, Donny was denied all physical contact with other human beings, and subjected to sensory and social deprivation. He was permitted to speak to visitors only via a phone through bullet-proof glass. Nevertheless, in 2002, against all the odds and through an initial ‘prisoners pen-pal’ contact and subsequent weekly correspondence with a New York writer and psychoanalyst, Stephen Kurtz, Donny began an intense and mutually transforming friendship. This relationship, expressed through over 500 letters, lies at the heart of this film. And while Donny revealed himself to be a fluent and incisive writer, even more remarkably, with encouragement from Steve, he became a dedicated artist – despite being refused access to conventional painting materials and forced to make brushes from his own hair, and to synthesise his pigments from the coloured sugar coatings of M&M’s and Skittles. As Donny himself cannot be interviewed, his life and emotionally charged journey of self-discovery are presented in the film via quotations from his many letters, read by the award-winning American actor Stanley Tucci. Donny’s ‘voice’ thus becomes the driving force of the documentary, articulating its main themes and topics, from his childhood to the present. Interwoven with Donny’s own words are vivid and articulate contributions from people involved in his life, among them his mother Helen Grimes, his now close friend Steve Kurtz, and his San Francisco-based prisoners' rights lawyer Charles Carbone. A further emotional level is added through music, in the form of specially recorded jazz/rock improvisations for electric guitar and a few songs that have particular significance for Donny.Donny’s life is an example of one man’s resilience and personal transformation, achieved in defiance of a prison system that locks up more of its citizens – mostly the poor – than any other country. And this unusual and provocative film celebrates creativity and friendship as the essential routes to self-realisation for prisoners whose humanity is systematically denied. Whether ‘indefinite confinement’ continues to be Donny’s fate was determined by a parole board hearing held in California’s High Desert State Prison on 19 April 2018. Despite evidence of Donny’s rehabilitation while in prison, his parole was not granted, with even a second hearing denied for a further five years. While the hearing could not be filmed, the tension leading up to the board’s decision, and its momentous emotional repercussions for Donny, his family and everyone else in his life, constitute the moving last sequence of the film."

Each one - from the song of the largest lemur to the song of the humpback whale to the song of the lyrebird - was recorded in his lifetime.When Sir David was born, the science of song had already been transformed by Charles Darwin’s theory of sexual selection: singing is dangerous as it reveals the singer’s location to predators, but it also offers the male a huge reward, the chance to attract a female and pass on genes to the next generation. Hence males sing and females don't. Today, new science in the field of birdsong is transforming those long-held ideas. Scientists are discovering that, in fact, in the majority of all songbird species, females sing - and it is only now they are being properly heard. Through this revelation and others, we can understand that animal songs are marvelous examples of the spectacular survival strategies that species have developed in order to stay alive."

Everything in the natural world is connected in networks that support the whole of life on earth, including us, and we are losing many of the benefits that nature provides to us. The loss of insects is threatening the pollination of crops, while the loss of biodiversity in the soil also threatens plants growth. Plants underpin many of the things that we need, and yet one in four is now threatened with extinction.   Last year, a UN report identified the key drivers of biodiversity loss, including overfishing, climate change and pollution. But the single biggest driver of biodiversity loss is the destruction of natural habitats.   Seventy-five per cent of Earth's land surface (where not covered by ice) has been changed by humans, much of it for agriculture, and as consumers we may unwittingly be contributing towards the loss of species through what we buy in the supermarket. Our destructive relationship with the natural world isn’t just putting the ecosystems that we rely on at risk. Human activities like the trade in animals and the destruction of habitats drive the emergence of diseases.   Disease ecologists believe that if we continue on this pathway, this year’s pandemic will not be a one-off event."

Smuggling themselves into the event, they brought the show to a sudden halt, shouting 'we’re not beautiful, we’re not ugly, we’re angry' and causing panic and confusion in front of the huge live TV audience.It was one of the era’s defining acts of protest and an inspiration to generations of activists. But it was also a night of other surprises. At a time of growing anti-apartheid protest, the first ever black South African contestant took part, under the dubious title Miss Africa South, along with the official, white Miss South Africa. The event also made headlines when the winner was finally announced as Miss Grenada, the first black Miss World.To coincide with the theatrical release of Misbehaviour, a major movie dramatisation of the story starring Keira Knightley, this documentary revisits the events of one extraordinary night when a beauty contest at the Albert Hall became the unlikely epicentre of the era’s dramatic political and social upheavals.Directed by Hannah Berryman and using archive, animation and contributions from key players, this film offers an entertaining and thought-provoking celebration of a night of game-changing anarchy.The film follows the protestors back to the Royal Albert Hall, water pistols in hand, as they recall the surprise and impact of their protests.

How can we mitigate the effects of light pollution so that the beauty of the night sky captured by Van Gogh might be preserved in the real world for future generations?Images and data from satellites have made it easy for us to visualise the extent of the growing effects of light pollution around the world, but speaking with Professor Kevin Gaston from the University of Exeter, Chris discovers that our current estimates show that global light pollution could be much worse than past data suggests. Without satellites capable of analysing the light emitted from the now-popular bluer LED lighting, he estimates that the true levels of light pollution could be around 200% more than was previously thought. Kevin and Chris discuss how light pollution is not just a problem for astronomers but can have devastating effects on animal behaviour and human health.Pete Lawrence visits one of the few places in the UK where you might still be able to catch a glimpse of the Milky Way. In Moore’s Reserve, named after Sir Patrick Moore, Pete meets up with Dark Skies Officer and South Down National Park ranger Dan Oakley, whose public outreach and passion for astronomy helped to get Dark Sky Reserve status for the area. Together they talk about the way towns and cities might change to help create more dark sky areas for the public to enjoy. In contrast, atop Television Centre in London - one of the country’s brightest cities – Chris joins the Baker Street Irregular Astronomers under a bright city night sky. The group demonstrate some tips and tricks to show us that, no matter where you are, you can still view and image some spectacular night sky objects.  And finally, Maggie looks at the latest risk to clear views of the night sky, mega-constellations and how satellite streaks that were once a novelty and easy to avoid are now becoming a nuisance to researchers and astronomers in many disciplines. Speaking to Tim Stevenson from the Square Kilometre Array Observatory, they discuss how mega-constellations disrupt radio telescopes that rely on a particular waveband to help their research of everything from galaxy formations and the chemical markers of life in the universe."

As television images of the burning twin towers in New York spread around the globe, normal life ended for many people as a series of events unfolded that would change the world forever.Using first-hand testimony, this documentary pieces together the seismic consequences that have been keenly felt in Scotland over the last 20 years, from the moment when the first plane impacted in New York, to the present day.Among those in Scotland whose lives were immediately affected were those in the Asian communities. As early reports suggested that those behind the attack were ‘Islamic’ and ‘extremist’, acts of racism became more common, more violent, and religious in nature. Muslims were suddenly faced with a very real and frightening backlash as they came under suspicion, were physically attacked, and their mosques were fire-bombed.Yasmine Chaudhry was attacked on a bus only two days after 9/11, with her attacker smashing a glass bottle over her head after making it clear that he was doing it because of the attack.Amjid Bashir was verbally attacked at McDonalds the next day. He had just attended Scotland’s biggest vigil for the victims when another customer suggested that a bullet should be added to his burger so his head ‘would be blown off’.The reaction was swift and unsurprising, and within a month, the US and UK led an invasion of Afghanistan to dismantle al-Qaeda, hunt down its leader, Osama Bin Laden, and remove the Taliban from power. The war in Iraq, just over a year later, was not so easily justified and huge protests sprung up against it. Campaigner Osama Bhutta was one of those who spoke at the Stop the War march outside Glasgow’s SECC while Tony Blair was giving a speech inside. He felt crushed when the coalition, again led by the US and UK, went ahead and Scottish troops found themselves embroiled in two wars thousands of miles from home.  Rose Gentle lost her 19-year-old son, Gordon, when he was killed while on a routine patrol in Basra. After his death, she became a strong opponent of the war in Iraq. The inquest into his death concluded that it was through the failure of the UK government to provide adequate equipment, that her son died.  Dave Devenney, a veteran Royal Marines Commando from the Falklands War in 1982, experienced both wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Scottish journalist David Pratt also saw both wars first hand. As foreign affairs editor for the Herald, he had reported from Afghanistan extensively from the days of the Russian occupation to the rise of the Taliban and had met Osama Bin Laden while there. Despite the war in Afghanistan, terror campaigns continued, throughout the US and Europe. In 2005, the 7/7 bombings wreaked bloody havoc on London’s transport network, and two years later in Scotland, the people inside Glasgow Airport narrowly avoided a similar fate when it was attacked by two men in a burning jeep laden with explosive gas.During this period the Muslim population of Scotland continued to feel the pressure of racist, violent and verbal attacks. Paramedic Araf Saddiq was verbally abused by patients who said they didn’t want to be treated by him as they thought he might be a terrorist.  It is thought that up to a million people may have died in the US War on Terror and the campaign, which is now the longest in US history, is only now coming to a chaotic end in Afghanistan, after almost 20 years. Yet despite these many traumas, and attacks that have continued since then, some feel that Scotland’s experience of terrorism and its aftermath has not brought about the severe splits and division that might have been expected."

The average age of a UK business owner is 49, even though 53% of young adults in England dream of setting up their own business.   Jake’s company disposes of illegal, damaged or unsafe products that come into ports all over the UK, recycling everything they can. Jake has seen everything from counterfeit clothing and rotting bananas to dodgy breast implants. The business has grown significantly over the last three years and now his mum, Julie, and his brother, Jez, work for him. But, despite his current success, things haven’t always been so easy for Jake. He struggled through school, routinely getting into trouble for acting as “the class clown”, to the frequent despair of his parents and teachers. This behaviour masked Jake’s frustrations with academic study due to his dyslexia. Jake ultimately left school with two GCSEs. Now, running a thriving business, Jake wants to show that success comes in many guises. He also wants to use his success to help other young people achieve their dreams. He sponsors two local sportsmen in Suffolk – Ryan, a boxer, and Rob, a race car driver – as well as sponsoring his older brother’s football team in West Sussex. We see him embark on what he calls his most daunting task yet – returning to his old college to inspire the next generation of young entrepreneurs."

Beginning in the famous Khyber Pass, he travels through Pakistan and India and ascends into Nepal and Tibet to reach Everest base camp itself, before venturing into the mountain kingdom of Bhutan.But Michael’s journey isn’t all about scaling peaks – it’s also about finding out what life is like for the people who live in some of the harshest environments on Earth. He is curious to see countries that were cut off by the mountains for centuries and that have developed their own distinct cultures and ways of survival, to discover the different ways that religion influences society here, and to meet the hardy inhabitants of the mountains.Along the way, Michael sees Pakistan’s historically volatile North West Frontier region and narrowly avoids a bull during a bull-racing festival. Crossing the border into India, he visits the Sikh city of Amritsar and the Golden Temple, where he learns about Sikhism and eats with the thousands of pilgrims who come there. And in Dharamshala, he learns about Buddhism and meets the Dalai Lama – who turns out to be a Palin fan.Moving ever upwards into the mountains, Michael suffers from altitude sickness, and at one point thinks he might have to give up. But he recovers and is rewarded with stunning views of the Annapurna range. Eventually, he reaches Everest base camp, where he reflects on the achievement of walking in the footsteps not only of Hillary but of the earlier British explorers Mallory and Irvine, who were childhood heroes of his.Being curious to find out how people live up at high altitude, he spends time with a Nepalese yak-herder and his family, making a real connection despite not speaking their language. In Nagaland, he has a chat with an elderly headhunter, who turns out to be much friendlier than he looks. Finally, Michael journeys through the isolated and magical nation of Bhutan, before descending to sea-level in Bangladesh."

He sits alongside Irish writing greats such as Heaney, Beckett and Yeats. His plays Faith Healer, Philadelphia Here I Come! and Translations took Irish theatre in completely new directions, while Dancing at Lughnasa brought it to totally different audiences.Yet an unwillingness to talk to the press and a withdrawal from public life in the mid 1980s mean that many have not understood how influential he was and remains. This film sets out to show how Brian Friel redefined Irish theatre in the second half of the 20th century, with his widow Anne giving intimate access to previously non-public family photos, Brian's writing room, original notebooks and copies of first drafts of plays.Artistic director of the Abbey Theatre Caitríona McLaughlin directs a workshop of actors reading extracts from Friel plays, highlighting his exploration of his era’s concerns around cultural identity, social change and political turmoil, the importance of language and the significance of history on the island of Ireland. Those ideas still resonate today. In a post-Brexit world, Friel’s work has never been more relevant."

Forces that politicians tried to forget and bury forty years ago - that then festered and mutated - but which are now turning on us with a vengeful fury. Piercing though the wall of our fake world."

More than 400,000 people in the UK are already signed up and the industry has thousands of passionate supporters.  But as Ellie digs deeper into two companies, she uncovers a darker side behind these enticing Instagram posts and investigates accusations of illegal pyramid selling, systematic targeting of vulnerable people by recruiters and even brainwashing.   Travelling the length of the country, Ellie meets former sellers like young mum Vickie, who made only £20 after spending six months following the training at cosmetics company Nu Skin in the hope she could make enough money for her maternity leave. Ellie also meets Lindsay, who has a chronic illness and hoped selling for makeup company Younique would help her cover the bills while she struggled to find full-time work. Three years later, Lindsay is now £3,000 in debt. In search of answers and accountability from these billion-dollar companies, Ellie’s investigation takes her to Utah, USA, where many of these companies are based. This film raises concerns about an industry which seems to remain largely overlooked by regulators and mainstream media. Ellie’s investigation uncovers a serious gap in awareness about the potential risks of becoming involved and lack of transparency about the true earning success rate."

We are there as they organise street protests and direct actions - risking arrest for their commitment to the cause. 16-year-old Dani from south London has never been on a protest before - since joining Extinction Rebellion in 2018, she has co-organised nationwide school strikes. Sam is 22 and a recent graduate, but now works full-time for Extinction Rebellion and is willing to get arrested again and again until something changes. Jack joined the movement recently at age 18. He is inspired by the tactics and research laid out by Extinction Rebellion and has an eye on organising controversial splinter actions for the movement. Ben also spends time with the leader of the movement, Roger Hallam, who has spent years academically researching tactics for social change. He says you need 2000 people to get arrested and 400 people to go to prison if you want the government to meet your demands. Ben challenges him on his methods and asks whether it is justifiable to encourage young people to break the law. This film is the first to get inside the new climate movements. It reveals how they have mobilised a generation to take radical action to help save the planet from climate change."

Can she keep it growing amid mounting challenges?","Ama Amo-Agyei, 25, went into the pandemic unemployed. Now, she’s running a successful wellness business from Reading, employing 18 members of staff and hoping to grow an empire. Stuck at home and suffering hair loss caused by alopecia, Ama began researching ancient Ayurvedic and African medicines during lockdown. She created a plant-based hair oil in her bedroom, sharing her experiment with her followers on social media. People slid into her DMs, asking if they could purchase her product – and she made her first sale of 100 bottles. As word spread, Ama started producing more and more products from her small bedroom, with a little help from her Ghanaian mother. In just one year she had made £1,000,000.  As a black female entrepreneur, Ama is part of a growing group. The number of businesses founded by black women is rising globally - yet they receive a disproportionately small amount of investment. Ama has defied the odds to build her successful hair care empire from scratch and funded it all with cash profits. But things took a turn in July 2021, when Ama was sued for inadvertently using another company’s brand name. She had to shut down production, close down her socials and start the brand from scratch. In this film, we meet Ama as she processes this massive blow to her fledgling company and see how she and her team go back to the drawing board, to rebuild their customer base under a brand new name. We follow her on the run-up to her relaunch, as she tackles supplier problems, technical hitches and all-important brand-building. We also see her navigate the hurdles of managing her mum, brother and several childhood friends, who all work for her. Ama is determined to make her mark in the world, ""this might be the business I pass on to my great-great grandkids. It’s not going to be the only business I have but this is going to be the start of it."""

She witnesses a commercial whale kill and meets the Faroese who kill for food and the activists trying to stop them.,"Stacey Dooley investigates the controversial world of whale hunting. This contentious practice has hit the headlines around the world as whaling countries defy international pressure to ban the practice. Whalers argue it is just food, like any other meat. Campaigners call it barbaric and outdated. With rare access to a Norwegian commercial hunting vessel, Stacey witnesses the killing of a minke whale. And on the remote Faroe islands, modern-day hunters defend their tradition of whale slaughter for food, while activists from around the world say they will keep coming to the island until they stop.Stacey heads to Norway, the world’s biggest commercial whaling nation. From the Lofoten Islands, off the country’s northern coast, Stacey joins skipper Bjorn and his crew on a minke whale hunt out to the Arctic Circle to fulfil an order from a local factory - each minke whale is worth around £7,000. On the fourth day at sea, Stacey witnesses Bjorn track and kill a seven-metre-long, five-tonne minke whale with an explosive harpoon grenade. The minke is not considered under threat from extinction and therefore is lawful to hunt in Norway. For the whalers, it is straightforward - the minke provides food and a living. Bjorn suggests critics are urban people who don’t understand the laws of nature. According to a Norwegian report, the harpoon delivers instant death on impact in 82% of killings, but the remaining 18% can take an average of six minutes to die - for many, this is an unacceptable level of cruelty.  Stacey also travels to the Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic. The Faroese drive pods of pilot whales and white-sided dolphins to designated bays where they are slaughtered by hand. In this 1,000-year-old tradition known as the grind, the meat is not sold but given free to those involved in the hunt. Stacey talks to islanders who defend the killing as environmentally sustainable and culturally important - from the grind foreman Magnus, who leads the whale hunts and objects to outsiders telling them how to live, to Armgard, a 24-year-old student who wants to get her license to kill. They maintain that the killing is instant and the animals are not in distress or pain during the grind.Stacey is shown dramatic footage of a recentgrind shot by British Sea Shepherd campaigner Sarah, who streamed the graphic images for the world to see. She argues that boats driving a pod of pilot whales to shore during a grind can take hours, leaving the mammals confused and disorientated. They believe the killing is inhumane and unregulated and cannot be justified because of tradition. Stacey questions a government official about the method of killing the whales and dolphins.Stacey is faced with highly charged and passionate people on both sides of the argument and a whole host of cultural differences as she searches for answers to whetehr there still a place for whale hunting in today’s world."

Stacey’s life is a whirlwind. She always throws herself into work and has struggled to prioritise her work-life balance. Although she is not a religious person, at the convent she is given the unique opportunity to try to connect to the rhythms of a deeper, slower, quieter and more meaningful way of being. But what are the challenges of living within the strict confines of a convent, where the women have taken vows of poverty, obedience and celibacy?Stacey must adhere to the nuns' strict timetable, eating meals in silence, learning how to pray and singing in their choir. Very little has changed at the convent in the 115 years since its foundation, but with an ageing population and fewer women being called to the vocation, this way of life is dying out. Stacey explores how the sisters - some of whom have been at the convent for half a century - cope with the rigidity of an old-fashioned, timetabled life, which is so removed from her chaotic everyday existence. Can living with these 23 devout sisters, who have dedicated themselves to a very different set of priorities, give her new insights into her own life that might last beyond her time with them?"

It’s this unlikely relationship that provides the inspiration for Afrofuturism, the broad cultural trend that encompasses works by Jean-Michel Basquiat to Grace Jones, Solange Knowles and Sun Ra. In this film, we meet, see and hear from artists across three continents who each, in their own way, explore the Afrofuture to look at the horrors of the black past and imagine alternative futures.The mysterious yet influential Detroit techno duo, Drexciya, take the Atlantic Ocean, a site of death and destruction during the African slave trade and reclaim it as a place of creation and beauty. Through a series of releases from the late 1990s through the early 2000s, they envisage the unborn children of enslaved pregnant women, thrown overboard during the Middle Passage to the Americas, adapting to breathe under water and thrive in a Black Atlantis. The mythos is vividly brought to life by the Drexciyan collaborator and graphic artist Abdul Qadim Haqq as a thriving, technological undersea world.Visual artist Ellen Gallagher similarly transforms the violence of the ocean into rebirth and renewal. Her film Osedax, made with Edgar Cleijne, is an imaginative retelling of how the skeletal remains of dead whales sustain new life in the curious form of the bone-devouring worm of the title. Whereas for artist Hew Locke, as well as the ocean itself, it’s the Atlantic’s coastal fringes that inspire his world of bricolage phantoms, plucked from the ghost stories of a Guyanese childhood. The Afrofuture is perhaps most commonly imagined through the rubric of outer space, thanks in no small part to avant-garde jazz musician and poet Sun Ra.  Born in the southern US in the early 20th century, Ra underwent an interplanetary conversion, claiming to have been teleported to Saturn. As with funk pioneer, George Clinton, who describes a similar close encounter with extraterrestrials, Ra’s identification with an alien presence can be read as more than simple escapism. It’s also a biting satire on the alienating experience of being black in America. For Ra, space is also an alternate destiny for black people, as the title of his 1973 Afrofuturist feature film Space is the Place insists. Reaching beyond these fictional ‘Afronauts’ is the conceptual artist Tavares Strachan. His performance piece, Star City, Training in Six Parts, sees Strachan visit the famous Russian space centre to undergo the same rigorous – and often tortuous – training of the Cosmonauts. Strachan likens one of the exercises, which measures our capacity to withstand disorientation and gravitational stress, to his impoverished upbringing in The Bahamas. The film concludes with an exploration of the idea of double consciousness. Coined in the early 20th century by WEB Du Bois, the influential African American sociologist, double-consciousness describes how black people in western societies see themselves twice over. Through their lived experience but also how they’re perceived within a dominant white culture.Curator and writer Ekow Eshun traces uses of the idea through Ralph Ellison’s lauded mid-20th-century novel Invisible Man, and painter Kerry James Marshall’s image of the same title, right up to the Black Lives Matter movement. Predicated upon recordings of anti-black violence often captured through digital tech, Eshun argues these ‘expose’ a double consciousness at work, the world as experienced and seen through black eyes, laid bare for all to witness. Other artists and commentators featured in the programme include Nuotama Frances Bodomo, Aria Dean, Ayesha Hameed, Kiluanji Kia Henda, Shabaka Hutchings, Elvira Dyangani Ose, Cauleen Smith and Greg Tate."

Britain boldly presents itself as a beacon of racial tolerance, but with demonstrations sweeping the country, organisers believe that they are closer than ever to changing the way British institutions and individuals treat black people across the UK. There have been multiple campaigns for equality and justice for black British communities in the past, but none quite like this. The worldwide response to George Floyd’s death has given confidence to a new generation that this time could be different. The people behind the protests in Britain believe that they have the tools, allies, language and technology to create a new reality - but is this country ready to move beyond tolerance, to become an actively anti-racist society? The Windrush scandal, Grenfell and a recent resurgence in far-right terror plots have exposed fault lines across Britain. Now the graphic nature of George Floyd’s death is forcing us all to ask questions about the scale of racism in our communities and to explore what can be done to eliminate it for good. From Premier League football clubs, to superstar actors like John Boyega, the message is loud and uncompromising: Black Lives Matter.

Between August and November, five horrifically violent murders took place in Whitechapel.  There was a huge manhunt, but the Ripper was never caught. Since then there has been endless speculation about who the Ripper was, what motivated his crimes, and how the killer escaped justice. Presented by the star of BBC One drama Silent Witness Emilia Fox and Britain’s top criminologist Professor David Wilson, this documentary casts new light on the Jack the Ripper case. Together Emilia and David look at the Ripper’s modus operandi using modern technology - like a digital autopsy table - and recreating the murder sites to help understand the extraordinary risks the Ripper took to kill his victims.  Also, using the Home Office Large Major Enquiry System (HOLMES), a bespoke computer system used by the police to help detect patterns in criminal activity, and evidence uncovered within the investigation, results strongly indicate that Martha Tabram was in fact the first Ripper victim.  Convinced that Martha Tabram was the Ripper’s first victim, Emilia and David ask a geographical profiling expert to take a fresh look at the pattern of Ripper murder sites, which takes the investigation in a completely different direction, ultimately identifying the most likely suspect.   The debate about Jack the Ripper’s true identity is already over 130 years old and is sure to continue, but this documentary casts new light onto the case and is as definitive as could be in naming the killer."

It is by far the most intimate and extensive portrait yet made of Kaufmann, now at the peak of his career. He was filmed behind the scenes at the Last Night of the Proms, when he was the first German to sing Rule, Britannia. His schedule was later interrupted for five months because of a vocal injury, but recently he made a triumphant return, notably in the production of Verdi's late opera, Otello, at Covent Garden. Kaufmann is filmed working with the Royal Opera's music director, Sir Antonio Pappano, and the stage director, Keith Warner - and is involved in every aspect of the preparations. He talks freely about his earlier cancellations, about what keeps him going during a run of performances, and about the problems of being a star.John Bridcut has previously made documentary portraits of Herbert von Karajan, Rudolf Nureyev, Mstislav Rostropovich and Sir Colin Davis (which was named Best Arts Documentary at the Grierson Awards). His clutch of composer-portraits began with the award-winning Britten's Children and continued with films on Elgar, Delius, Parry and Vaughan Williams. Last year he made the BBC One documentary for the Queen's 90th birthday, Elizabeth at 90 - A Family Tribute."

It's an irreverent and witty exploration into one man's obsessions, a bohemian life lived on the New York fringes and a uniquely twisted take on the American dream. Bob Dylan once said 'I don't think I'm gonna be really understood until maybe 100 years from now'. Author of the Dylan To English Dictionary, a Dylanologist and originator of garbology (the practice of rooting through rubbish in order to gain insight into prominent people's lives), Weberman has made it his life's work to understand Dylan.At times both hilarious and disturbing, the film is not only a great companion piece to Scorsese's No Direction Home but an interesting observation on our unbalanced desires to know more about celebrities and how far we are willing to go to get that information or even become a part of their lives. Weberman does not see himself as a stalker and insists that Dylan should be grateful that he is around: 'how was I to know I would have been to Dylan what Verlaine was to Rimbaud'. It's hard to see this as a tale of poet and critic, but rather a look at the bizarre relationship between the obsessed and the object of his obsession and how it can completely take over a man's life. Beginning in the 1960s when Dylan was at the height of his early fame and regarded as something close to a prophet or a seer by the American counter-culture, Weberman has sought to try and climb inside Dylan's head by going through his rubbish. Back then he pursued his obsession relentlessly.An amusing telephone conversation between Weberman and Dylan, recorded in the 1970s, punctuates the film in the form of animations, creating connections between Weberman's past and present.The film also features an unforgettable cast of supporting characters close to Weberman, including New York street singer David Peel, former child dancer Jay Byrd and Aaron Kay aka 'The Pieman', and enjoys a vivid Americana soundtrack performed by cast members, adding an extra veneer of strangeness to Weberman and his universe."

Without them the NHS would have been in danger of collapse - not least during the current COVID crisis - but from the very start the story of this beloved British institution has been intertwined with one of the most divisive social and political issue of the age, immigration.

The programme gives voice to the moving and often raw experiences of nurses from the Irish Republic, the Caribbean and the Philippines, GPs and surgeons from India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka and paramedics from Central Europe, as well as to the British-born children and grandchildren of immigrants who have found themselves helping and healing with one hand while fending off the sharp end of discrimination and racism with the other.

Filmed during the new management’s first season in charge of the club, the documentary follows the struggles of the Highland League side on and off the pitch and the lives of the locals for whom the club means so much.For a long time FWFC have been bad, really bad. Serial losers. They have finished bottom of the Highland League (the fifth tier of Scottish football) for 14 of the past 20 years. The team has not won a match for a very long time, something that has helped them achieve cult status across social media. Now they face an existential crisis.In the summer of 2018, after a winless season, the board of directors, made up of local business owners and volunteers, all stepped down. Having devoted their lives and invested significant time and money in the club for five years they had decided enough was enough. The end was near for the club that had fought so hard to gain entry to the Highland League back in 1985.Most in the town have no interest whatsoever in their football team. Many FWFC players have to make seven-hour round trips on match day, travelling from Skye, Inverness and beyond. Shinty is the most popular game in the area and the first choice sport for most local young people, making player recruitment a huge problem for FWFC, but not their only one.The disparity of wealth in the league could not be greater. The top teams buy players for transfer fees up to £40,000 while FWFC players receive a £20 match fee and a likely loss by a similar number of goals. There is a win bonus, but in recent years it is not something the club have ever needed to pay, perhaps mercifully for their meagre accounts. Average match attendance, at one of the rainiest but most scenic grounds in the country, is 60-70 people. This occasionally includes the odd football fanatic who has travelled hundreds of miles to see 'the worst team in Britain', a title the club's new management have high hopes of changing.At the start of the 2019/20 season the club was handed a lifeline. A group of locals, with no previous experience running a football club, stepped in to take over management of FWFC. They want to reverse the rot and return the team to winning ways. They spent their summer putting a new team together, recruiting a manager and starting to renovate the dilapidated old clubhouse. It is a work in progress.Despite the numerous challenges, FWFC is a surprisingly optimistic place. It is hard not to fall in love with the location and the people. There is a genuine belief the club can turn things around. What drives those involved to persevere with what many see as a hopeless, embarrassing existence? This is the question explored at the heart of the film through its central cast of characters.As well as providing an entertaining 'warts and all’ insider's view of the workings of a struggling football club, the film explores the cast's daily lives in the Scottish highlands. Club secretary Russell has experienced psychological trauma from his work as a police officer. Club director Woody mixes football with farming a croft and catering for tourists at his holiday caravan park on the shores of Loch Eil, whilst committee member Mikey is striving to rid himself of gambling addiction to become a better single father, juggling time with the kids and working shifts at the area’s biggest employer, the local aluminium plant.The characters represent a region defined by its picturesque location and the industries that feed off the country’s biggest mountain.The Fort is a warm, funny and emotive portrait of a real community at work in pursuit of its passion - despite, or perhaps because of their football club's many existential challenges."

Ashley John-Baptiste hears from those whose lives have been changed forever.,"Ashley John-Baptiste is a BBC reporter who grew up in foster care and spent most of his life believing he was an only child. That is until his mid-20s, when he received a life-changing message. A man contacted him on social media telling him that he was his brother. As it was with Ashley, some children in care grow up completely unaware of their siblings. More common, however, are cases where looked-after children do know about their siblings – but are split up once in care. The law says they should stay together if it's safe and appropriate to do so, but around half of sibling groups in care in the UK are separated.To find out why this is happening, Ashley hears from young people and children whose lives have been changed forever by the impact of separation.In Derby, the director of children's social care explains to Ashley that councils are ‘close to the bone’ and allows him to join a new rapid response team that's just supported a family and sibling group to stay together. Amidst a shortage of foster carers, Ashley seeks advice from Debbie Bright from The Only Way Is Essex. She has looked after more than 200 children in 30 years and introduces Ashley to 23-year-old Bryleigh, who has recently become a foster carer herself.A new law is Scotland is giving brothers and sisters in care more rights over their relationships than ever before. Ashley meets foster carer Karen in Fife, who has been instrumental in the changes and runs a farm where split-up siblings can come to rebuild their bonds. For the first time ever, cameras are allowed to capture the reunion of five siblings who are living separated and only see each other two hours every two months. As a part of his quest for answers, Ashley traces back one of his own social workers and uncovers revelatory news that will, once again, impact his life."

It is also the story of how the talents of a golden generation of artists were forever preserved on film. Nupen came from an unlikely background in South Africa and ‘ticked none of the boxes’, but seizing upon the emerging camera technology and his unique access, he filmed classical music in a completely new and intimate way that broke down the barriers between artists and their public. As a result, this documentary is also an important story about the history of music on television and the great artists who collaborated on the films.   Now 86, Nupen reflects on 75 productions about artists and composers spanning more than 50 years. His body of work convincingly enforces his conviction that television is capable of remembering artists in a way that no other medium can equal. Oxford philosopher and historian Sir Isaiah Berlin described Nupen’s films as being ‘at just about the highest level which television is capable of reaching’.The programme cherry-picks examples of Christopher Nupen’s best work between 1966 and 2017. When he started, he instinctively blended documentary and musical performance to create a new genre of film. He filmed musicians at close quarters in their natural environment, where they have most to offer. Television picked up the exuberant spirit of the new generation and carried it far and wide. The effects were dramatic and brought countless numbers of people to music for the first time.A musician himself, Nupen’s musical friends were among the most-renowned artists of the 20th and 21st centuries. Capturing their unique talents on film, we relive sublime historical moments with the likes of Daniel Barenboim, Pinchas Zukerman, Andrès Segovia, John Williams, Nathan Milstein, Placido Domingo, Itzhak Perlman, Jacqueline du Pré, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Evgeny Kissin and Daniil Trifonov.As Nupen’s experience grew, he tackled musical ideas and the lives of the great composers. His films represent a single-minded dedication to sharing the power of music that will leave a legacy of lasting value."

We see the workers and donors keeping life going.,"Blood donation fell with Covid-19, now the NHS is on its biggest blood drive ever. And one NHS staffer is inspired to give even more than blood to a stranger - her kidney.","Supply and demand – it’s the crucial equation that the NHS Blood and Transplant Service (NHSBT) must balance as hospitals reopen afterpandemic lockdowns and the need for transfusions grows again. During the pandemic, hospitals in England were kept supplied with blood by the smallest pool of donors in the 21st century - almost 40,000 fewer annual donors than before Covid-19. Blood donor numbers have yet to return to pre-pandemic levels and now the NHSBT is on its biggest blood drive ever, seeking to attract 100,000new donors. 25-year-old Sasha Cooke was an actor when film and theatre production stopped in the first lockdown. Without work, her career took an unexpected turn and she signed up to train as an NHS blood donor carer. Now Sasha works full time collecting donor blood at clinics across London. Witnessing the daily selflessness of others has led Sasha to make a big decision: she has volunteered to donate one of her kidneys to a complete stranger. We follow Sasha as she undergoes this process up to the moment her kidney is given to its recipient.Sasha is part of the cross-England NHSBT that includes specialist technicians, transport drivers and scientists working at one of Europe’slargest blood processing centre at Filton, near Bristol. Working 24/7, the Filton team distributes up to a million blood donations a year across thecountry. Among some patients, demand for blood is particularly high. Sickle cell disorder has become the UK’s fastest-growing genetic disorder,disproportionately affecting Black African and Black Caribbean communities. 19-year-old Abdul Samad Abdullah is a sickle cell patient who needs monthly red blood cell exchanges. An aspiring architectural designer from Milton Keynes, Abdul depends on the blood of strangers. He is one of the 15,000 people affected by sickle cell disorder in the UK. We go behind the scenes of blood and organ donation in England, documenting the personal motivations and the science allowing donors to give the gift of life to complete strangers."

During the Second World War, government scientists from Porton Down attempted to weaponise anthrax, creating a deadly strain that they then tested on Gruinard Island, an uninhabited remote site off the coast of Scotland.This proved disastrous for Gruinard and, from 1942 onwards, people were forbidden from setting foot on the island. Signs were erected on the shore and the adjacent mainland, and Gruinard was dubbed The Island of Death or Anthrax Island.This documentary reveals an extraordinary Scottish story from 1981, when a shadowy group called the Dark Harvest Commandos claimed to have landed on the island and removed 300lbs worth of infected soil.They wrote a dramatic letter explaining and justifying their actions, which was sent to various newspapers and the BBC. In the letter, they explained their campaign to clean up Gruinard had begun with a package of island soil dumped outside Porton Down.Nobody knew who they were or if they were serious."

Using cutting-edge technology in this extended special we celebrate the highlights from the series. From the intense heat of the tropics to our planet's frozen poles, through to its unexplored depths, we reveal new worlds and extraordinary never-seen-before animal behaviours.Starting in the tropical coral reefs - the most diverse ocean habitat - a tusk fish demonstrates a surprising level of ingenuity - tool use - as it uses corals as an anvil to break open clams. In the Seychelles, half a million terns nest on an island. Fledglings must eventually take to the wing, but danger lurks beneath the waves: metre-long giant trevally fish leap clear out of the water to snatch birds on the wing.In the tropics sun heats the sea, creating rain, winds and huge storms that drive up towards higher latitudes. Here the seas change with the seasons. In spring thousands of mobula rays gather in Mexico's Sea of Cortez. At night, in a previously unseen event, tiny organisms that light up when disturbed react to their wingbeats, creating an enchanting bioluminescent firework display.The seasonal seas are home to bountiful kelp forests. In the undersea forests of southern Africa, one resident - the common octopus- has become the ultimate escape artist. To outwit her nemesis, the pyjama shark, she uses ingenious tactics, never filmed before. On the coast, two worlds collide. Where sea meets land, coasts are the most dynamic and challenging habitats in the ocean. The ever-changing tides create rock pools. But these temporary worlds are a battleground. Predatory starfish turn a magical garden into the stuff of nightmares.The big blue is the world's greatest wilderness - it's a vast marine desert where there is little to eat and nowhere to hide. Sometimes there is a brief explosion of food in this marine desert, but ocean hunters must be fast to make the best of this bonanza. We witness super-pods of up to five thousand spinner dolphins racing to herd vast shoals of lanternfish, briefly caught at the surface where it is thought they spawn. New aerial footage reveals, for the first time, the spectacular feeding frenzy of 90kg tuna and dolphins smashing through the lantern fish shoals turning the sea white with foam.The deep is perhaps the most hostile environment on Earth, at least to us - a world of crushing pressure, brutal cold and utter darkness. We have barely begun to explore it and yet it is the largest living space on our blue planet, home to strange worlds like methane volcanoes and undersea lakes of salty brine. But life adapts in ingenious ways, like the sea toad - a fish that walks instead of swims. And barrel-eye - a deep sea fish with a translucent skull so that it can see through the top of its head to make the most of any glimmer of light.The deep is more closely connected to our own world than we ever thought possible due to giant ocean currents. We join these ocean currents as they begin their lives in Antarctica and flow from the poles to the tropics and back again, linking every ocean. Ocean currents move heat around our planet and maintain a climate favourable for life. But our ocean system, in relative equilibrium for millennia, is changing at a worrying rate.Deep in the polar north, we meet walrus mothers and their newborn calves, searching for an ice floe to rest on but with rising temperatures, summer sea ice is retreating- their battles to survive are becoming ever harder. As we begin to understand the true complexity of the lives of our ocean creatures so do we recognise the fragility of their home."

Not wanting to add to the problem of single-use plastics sat in landfill and polluting our oceans, they spent the next few years developing a brand of crisps with sustainability running through its core.  Now they make crisps in a purpose-built factory on the farm that is powered entirely by renewable power from their own renewable energy plant that runs on crops and waste from the farm. They’ve developed the world’s first plastic-free crisp packets, which are fully compostable. To keep the food miles down to a minimum, and to support other local farmers, they only use flavours for their crisps from local farmers such as Charles Martel whose Hereford cheese flavour is one of their most popular. But investment has spiralled way past their initial estimates and they’ve had to borrow from their own businesses as well as applying for bank loans and grants. To mitigate their costs, they’ve eschewed the normal distribution networks and taken their product to market themselves. But can they sell their crisps, and have they done enough to keep their farms going for the next generation?"

He discovers why the new towns are there and how they enticed people out of the bigger cities, and uncovers the surprising ways in which public art changed the new towns and the new towns changed public art.Mark's father, Stan, made sculptures that stand to this day on the streets of Glenrothes, East Kilbride and the Scottish new town that never was, Stonehouse. These new towns employed town artists to make artworks in the very housing precincts the new residents were moving into.Stan Bonnar was the first assistant to seminal town artist David Harding in Glenrothes in the early 70s, then became town artist himself at East Kilbride and Stonehouse Development Corporation later on in the decade. His first new town artwork was the concrete hippos that have stalked Glenrothes for almost 50 years.Scotland’s new town artists were at the forefront of a shift in thinking that changed the relationship between art and public places. Rather than plinths and bronze likenesses of dead soldiers and politicians, this art would be found in playgrounds,  on underpasses, by bus stops, and could be seen out of people’s living room windows. The environment and surroundings of the work were seen as part of the art itself, the context in which the sculptures stand being part of what they have to say. The new town art was there for everyone, designed to define the places it was made and to mean something to the people who lived alongside it.Mark uncovers the relationship between the new towns and their art, tracing a legacy of the approach taken by the development corporations and revealing the impact of the town artists’ work in the communities they were made for. Across Scotland, from Irvine in the west, via East Kilbride, Cumbernauld, Livingston and Glenrothes, Mark travels to talk with former town artists such as David Harding, Malcolm Robertson, Mary Bourne and Denis Barns, and to learn about Brian Miller. On his travels, he finds out how some work has survived, some has been damaged and some lost. This journey takes Mark closer to an understanding of his father’s approach to art and helps him grasp the context and legacy of the towns, the artists and their work."

In 2006 and again in 2011, Louis uncovered a world of indoctrination masterminded by church-founder and figurehead Pastor Fred Phelps, known amongst his congregation as Gramps. But since his death in 2014, the church has experienced a significant change that has threatened to tear apart what was once a tight-knit family community and challenged their relevance in Trump’s America, where outrageous statements are par for the course. As well as a series of allegations about Pastor Phelps’s final days, including rumours of mental illness and his excommunication, the church has also been hit by a number of high-profile family defections, including Pastor Phelps's granddaughter Megan, now Westboro’s most prominent critic. Yet despite the unrest, the church has continued to attract new members, including Bradford-born Mathias Holroyd, who sees Westboro’s fire-and-brimstone rhetoric as the perfect tonic to his struggle to fit in with modern-day Britain. Immersing himself in the strange and unpleasant world of Westboro, Louis explores what happens when a hate-group largely populated by one family loses its patriarch. And, as he discovers, Pastor Phelps’s doctrine of divine hate has cast a shadow not only on the church's true-believers but also on those who have managed to escape Westboro's vice-like grip."

Born in Brazil, raised in Lebanon and educated in France, Ghosn personified the globalised free-trade system he built his career on. He came to prominence in 1999, when he led one of the most improbable turnarounds in corporate history and saved Nissan from bankruptcy. The first businessman to serve simultaneously as CEO for two Fortune 500 companies, he attained a level of celebrity status in Japan seldom bestowed on chief executives. Fans asked for autographs, a comic book on his life became a best-seller, he was invited to talk shows, and other businessmen envied his success. But he was also representative of the bloated excesses of corporate CEOs. After his sudden arrest by Japanese authorities, his detractors painted a picture of a visionary leader turned despot who took advantage of his position of power for personal gain."

But with many new and inexperienced players, do they stand a chance?","The Bath Romans are a wheelchair basketball team set up in 2019. Since pandemic restrictions have lifted, their numbers have more than doubled. They are gearing up for a match against one of the best teams in the country, the Exeter Otters, but with so many new and inexperienced players, do the Romans stand a chance? Leighton is the team’s newest player, having only played for a few weeks. He was on track to be a professional footballer when he was younger, but a lifelong condition resulting in chronic pain forced him to find a new sport. Keen to build friendships with his new team, Leighton also opens up to manager and club founder, Alex, about his past.  Kayleigh is the Bath Romans' queen of banter, and club manager Alex, who finds her hilarious, is often at the receiving end. Kayleigh jokes that Alex is the worst player on the team despite being one of the only players without a disability.  She is one of the more experienced players and started using a wheelchair after having an injury when she was 11. With the game just around the corner, a recent shoulder injury means Kayleigh’s aim of scoring in her first match in over two years might be out of reach. To many players, training is the highlight of their week. Player Simeon says it’s one of the only places he can go and not feel judged ‘I can just be me when I’m at training.’ Simeon fell in love with the sport when he was eight years old after seeing it on TV. After recently returning to the sport, he has concerns around his fitness and is nervous in the lead up to the match, ‘I just want to be able to keep up with my teammates.’Wheelchair basketball allows both disabled and non-disabled players to take part. Alex, who doesn’t have a disability, founded the Bath Romans due to the lack of clubs in the area, and partly because he wanted somewhere to play himself. He was surprised at how many new players joined after the pandemic, ‘I thought the pandemic would damage the club but if anything we’ve blossomed’.The team train hard to prepare for their first big match, but do they have what it takes to compete with the much more experienced Exeter Otters?"

Sue, an ex-fishmonger from Bath, is shocked to learn the science of climate change, and when floods hit the UK - and the south west in particular - she begins to understand how close to home these issues can be and resolves to make personal changes. British Gas employee Marc from Newcastle is enthusiastic about taking part in the assembly, but is worried about losing his job in the transition to green energy, while 27-year-old postal worker Amy is unsettled when she learns the environmental impact of the coal fire she heats her home with. We also meet retired printer Richard, who is sceptical about climate change and reluctant to accept many of the proposals put forward in the assembly. But when his own health deteriorates, he is forced to re-examine the impact of dirty air on all our lives.Through this cast of warm, funny Brits, we understand the challenge we all face in the effort to reduce climate change and start to see what the future might look like in a greener world."

With over seven million people being prescribed antidepressants each year in England alone, this drug trial is an important milestone in understanding a completely different treatment for depression.

The empirical results of the trial are explored alongside the participants’ powerful lived experience."

The Swiss Alpine hotel was the birthplace of winter tourism more than 150 years ago.","In this Christmas special, Giles and Monica travel to Kulm Hotel, St Moritz. This Swiss Alpine hotel was the birthplace of winter tourism more than 150 years ago. The Kulm's owner, Johannes Badrutt, made a bet with summer guests that if they returned in the winter and didn't enjoy themselves he would pay for their stay. The guests stayed for the season - and a new industry of winter leisure and sports was born. The current managers of the Kulm (one of whom was born there!) try to embrace the hotel's history whilst finding new ways to attract younger generations. Giles launches into the traditional grand hotel's life by being fitted up for a bellboy's uniform to work alongside veteran head concierge Silvio. With 44 years at the Kulm under his belt, Silvio dispatches Giles to collect the luggage of departing guests with a plane to catch. Armed with no apparent sense of direction, Giles wrestles a brass trolley with a mind of its own through the warren of corridors and lifts, just about managing to deliver the cases intact.Monica helps joint MD Jenny transform her office into a private dining room for the evening. It is in the oldest part of the hotel and used to be the living room of the hotel's first owner, Badrutt. Using the first hotelier's original dinner service, silverware and glassware, today's office is restored to late-19th-century style for a nostalgic candlelit dinner. Badrutt's bet triggered a flood of privileged guests to this Alpine winter wonderland, who began devising forms of snow-bound entertainment. Jenny's husband Heinz shows Giles the hotel's historic Sunny Bar, which celebrates the 1884 creation of the infamous Cresta Run - an ice track that winds down to the village and is a forerunner of Olympic skeleton. Giles tries his hand at a favourite apres-ski challenge, and in the hotel archives he leafs through old magazines created by early guests: the 19th-century version of Instagram. In the present day, Monica heads up the slopes to get to grips with the monsters of the mountains - the piste-bashing machines that groom the slopes, including those forming the longest floodlit ski run in Switzerland. With head concierge Silvio, Giles delivers mail and meets one of the hotel's permanent residents (the largest serviced apartment here can cost £250,000 a year). Giles also learns that Silvio is about to retire and discovers how Silvio has loved and lost during his nearly five decades at the Kulm.Giles and Monica take the cable car to the highest accessible point on the mountain to meet suppliers of the hotel's Swiss whisky. In this high altitude cave, where lack of oxygen assists the ageing process, the presenters help to decant whisky into a wine barrel and hear how the producers hope to open one of the world's highest distilleries. Down in the hotel, Monica prepares dinner service with blue-haired Peruvian chef Claudia, whom Heinz hired to shake up the hotel's culinary offerings. As they make ceviche together, with the aptly-named 'tigers' milk' (hangover cure) dressing, Monica learns how bringing Peruvian cuisine to the Alps felt like a big risk but offers a refreshing Alpine alternative. Giles joins Heinz and Jenny for family time in a shepherd's hut and meet Heinz's parents, who ran the Kulm for 30 years, to gain their perspectives on some of the changes taking place. Heinz then takes Monica on a forward-thinking excursion that he's starting to offer guests - a helicopter ride to an isolated mountain peak for a cheese, champagne and truffle fondue (it is all very James Bond). On much lower slopes, Giles faces his lifelong distaste for skiing by working alongside ski instructor Matteo and accelerates from novice skier to leading (and not wiping out) a class of children.By the end of the process Giles develops a tentative approval of the sport and a love of barking instructions in German. Finally, Giles and Monica's double dog date takes them across St Moritz's frozen lake, often used for winter polo matches, and provides them with a fresh view of the hotel."

They were working hard and counting on providing better opportunities and education for their children. However, in a white-dominated country, where the politics were becoming increasingly racialised, there was a question of how society, and its teachers, saw these young black children.Before having a chance to develop intellectually, they were labelled as stupid, difficult and disruptive. The paradox is that many of the new migrants to Britain were in fact highly educated. One of them was Gus John, who arrived from Trinidad as a Dominican novitiate to become a priest. Almost immediately he was contacted by some black parents worried about the schooling of their children. Together with several other educators, John quickly realised that the system was not just inept, but actually rigged against black children. At the same time, celebrity psychologists Hans Eysenck and Arthur Jensen were propounding theories that black people were genetically less intelligent than white people. These theories infiltrated teacher training and found their way into schools. IQ tests were then based on these theories with the odds horrendously stacked against children from the West Indies."

And, with the final on 11 July taking place on the hallowed turf of Wembley, football really is coming home this summer. In We Are England, Krept and Konan, two of the UK’s most talented and successful rap artists, are setting out to mark what is sure to be a huge shared cultural moment by making a track to celebrate the England football team. But first they need to investigate what Englishness actually means in 2021. It’s never been a simple question for those of non-white British heritage, but it’s a question they’ll need to tackle if they are going to create an authentic track to celebrate the national squad.   Because instead of the traditional cheesy sing-along, featuring a former soap actor or long-retired left-back, Krept and Konan are going to create an anthem for our times: representing the modern diversity and forward-looking culture in which our chart-topping rap stars and the young stars of the England team are cut from the same cloth. Rap culture is the culture of young Britain, and today’s top-tier teams now move to a whole different beat than they did when the Three Lions anthem of Euros 96 had them tapping their toes in the changing rooms and their fans chanting on the terraces. The lifestyle, attitude, slang and swagger of rap culture is replicated in the national football team – itself now one of the youngest and most diverse it has ever been – and many of the country’s biggest rappers came up honing their football skills and their rap lyrics on our city streets and in the ‘cages’ of the UK’s estates, just as top footballers grew up surrounded by hip hop culture, looking up to rap stars.   So if they’re going to create a track to celebrate the pride of a new nation, it’s these stories that Krept and Konan want to tell, and this bold, aspirational culture they want to reflect. On their journey into exploring national identity, they hit the road, striking out beyond the streets of the capital as they get to know the England squad, meeting players including Everton’s Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Aston Villa’s Tyrone Mings and West Ham’s Declan Rice as well as retired Lioness legend, Eni Aluko. They also seek advice from fellow artists including chart-topping Manchester rapper Aitch who they meet at Old Trafford, and west London rapper Big Zuu as they watch some football anthems from days gone by to see just how much our national culture has changed. They also go to St George’s Park, home of the England team, where they get an exclusive audience with England manager Gareth Southgate to find out what ingredients he’d like to see making it into the final song."

Built to last just 30 years, the temporary sarcophagus is now crumbling, putting the world at risk of another release of radioactive dust. Radiation levels make it impossible for workers to build the new shelter directly over the old reactor, so engineers are erecting the new megastructure - taller than the tower of Big Ben and three times heavier than the Eiffel Tower - to one side and will then face the challenge of sliding the largest object ever moved on land into place over the old reactor."

It's football in the danger zone, can he make it work?","Former Aberdeen, Rangers and Leeds United stalwart Davie Robertson is a long way from home. In fact, he is a long way from anywhere. He is the new manager of Real Kashmir FC, and he has left behind his wife and the millionaire lifestyle he earned from football, to live in a shared house in a city that regularly suffers violent protests and terrorist attacks.Why? What is it about football that drives him so far to be the manager of Real Kashmir FC? For Davie it’s because few things in life can match the highs and lows of football. Real Kashmir are up-and-comers, newly promoted to a league where most of the other teams have much deeper pockets, more fans and a longer history. To beat them Davie must put into action his 'masterplan'. But against the background of chaos in Jammu and Kashmir will it ever work? In a place where violent protests erupt most weekends, the electricity is routinely switched off - meaning no internet, phones, or television - even the basics can be a struggle, so organising and motivating a diverse team drawn from India, Africa and Europe to play top-flight football is no easy task. 'Some of the boys pray at different times, some are vegetarian so telling them about a proper diet and running a schedule where everyone is there is always difficult. All the different religions pray at different times!'However, this is not just a footballing story it's also a story of hopes, dreams, and family. Davie's obsession with football has driven him to the ends of the earth, and in amongst the struggle for success on the field he has to learn to live in very unfamiliar world, far from his wife Kym. Davie's used to the comforts his success in football brought him. With Kym and his two children he enjoyed living in the States - where he moved after his playing career came to an early end - but his son, Mason, is now a regular in the Real Kashmir team, living in Srinagar near his father. Together they have a chance to explore a part of the world that is both stunningly beautiful and so riven with violence that the UK's Foreign Office advises against all but essential travel to the team's home base in Srinagar.Kym worries about Davie and Mason living and working in a conflict zone. When Davie announced that the move to Kashmir was a possibilty Kym - a self-confessed football widow - says only half joking that 'divorce was considered'. 'David came in with the Real Kashmir deal and tried to sell it to me. I'm like 'no, not doing it'. So we didn't speak and then on New Year's Eve 2016 David got on a plane to India!'.As the new season - the first since Davie helped Real Kashmir secure promotion to the Indian 'I' League - starts Davie needs to make sure his team believes they can win. It is here that manager can lift ordinary players into world-beaters. As each big game approaches everything needs to be right. He has lifted his team before and gotten them promoted but can they succeed in the new league? Is Davie's masterplan for success is going to work? Has what it takes to be a manager."

It offers a dizzying analysis of the madness of the Orion myth alongside a movingly sympathetic account of Ellis's unsung talent."

But he has a great team, a sense of humour and boundless optimism. Will the election be a moment of change for Kenya? Will the sacrifice for Boniface be too great?"

Juice may provide the elusive evidence of extraterrestrial life in our solar system.Another mission, BepiColumbo - en route to Mercury – was in the news in October, when it made the initial flypast of its target, sending back its amazing first glimpses of the planet.

Where Does It All Come From is a window into Catling’s world that, like Catling himself, defies categorisation. It is shaped through a stitching-together of rediscovered archive material with newly shot interviews, fragments of previously unseen filmworks, interjections and interactions, ghosts and revenants. Important locations in Catling’s life and work – south London and Whitechapel, museums, churches, dives, Gozo, Leipzig, Copenhagen – are interwoven with imaginary landscapes and revisited, explored or recreated. Interviews and long-lost performances are remade and repurposed, seances held, dead or vagrant voices resuscitated. Characters, symbols and strange beings – some of whom then reveal their role and purpose – are glimpsed or merely spoken of, sometimes without explanation. At times, fiction hijacks fact to reveal other, deeper truths.We see Catling at work, in the past and the present, in public performance, on stage, conjuring uncanny presences in galleries, abandoned rooms and in his studio. His histories are told, including childhood obsessions with outsiders and monsters, the early days of art school and labouring jobs at Truman’s Brewery, becoming an artist, a sculptor and maker of installations, and his decision to retreat from the London art world.A host of writers, artists, musicians, curators and former students, including actor Ray Winstone recollecting a terrifying encounter in London’s Whitechapel, are also called upon to bear witness to a creative spirit who defies definition and is capable of endless self-reinvention."

London – the crowning example of the uniquely British inner city mash up of race, class and culture – has been the crucible for a series of original and unique music genres and pop culture lifestyles that have set the world alight. The recipe has been further enriched by contributions from other key urban centres – cities like Bristol and Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. Inspired by the bass heavy rhythms of Jamaican sound systems, fused with the culture, fashion, slang and attitude of the Caribbean, West Africa, Asia and America, fueled by a never-ending soundtrack of pirate radio, and led by successive generations of entrepreneurs, hustlers and maverick visionaries, the whole world has moved to the beats of underground music and club culture made right here, in Britain.  This is the story of Jungle, UKG and Grime – three massive underground music scene that were all ‘Made in Britain.’ These more recent genres exploded from the streets, pirate radio stations and council estates of London and the UK’s inner cities over a period of just a few years in the 1990s. All three gave birth to their own unique sounds, creating a generation of stars, fashions, club scenes and fortunes and all three never quite vanished. Their beats, flows and attitude can still be heard in tunes being made today.  Each episode gives the inside track one of the genres, as told by some of the leading figures who created these underground movements in the first place, in conversation with Ron Samuels, himself a leading light of the original 90s Jungle scene as DJ Ron, and now a documentary director."

With unlimited access to Paloma as a woman, a mother and an international pop star, this film follows her on an emotional journey as she balances the demands of a vital make-or-break tour with writing a new album, launching an acting career and being a first-time mum. The film observes Paloma’s life both front and backstage in the midst of this pivotal year for her career. We see her struggling with choices every mum will be familiar with, whilst embarking on enormous career challenges in a cut-throat business. Paloma not only returns to work after having her baby, but also to huge expectations to break Australia and America.A familiar presence on the London underground circuit for several years, Paloma Faith eventually broke into the mainstream thanks to her ultra-flamboyant theatrical style and retro-soul sound. Born in Hackney to a Spanish father and English mother, at the age of 18 she made her debut on the cabaret scene, singing in a covers band called Paloma and the Penetrators, before performing as a magician’s assistant and appearing in a burlesque troupe. After turning down an opportunity to join Amy Winehouse’s band, she began writing and performing her own songs, and soon earned a reputation as one of London’s most exciting and flamboyant live acts. She hit the big time in 2009 after releasing her first album, which reached number two in the UK and went platinum within weeks of release. Since then, she has sold well over a million records, with three more albums released, each of which went double platinum and reached number one in the album charts. She is a household name in Britain, having been a judge on The Voice and having had roles in numerous television series and films. Now, after returning to work following the birth, she will star as the villain in a new Batman TV series, write and launch her fifth album, and, she hopes, crack America – all while being a working mum.The film sees Paloma pitted against a music industry that does not always look to kindly on motherhood, and with Paloma’s unrelenting ambition, the question the film asks is 'Can a woman have it all?' In seeing Paloma’s attempts to achieve this very goal, the film raises fundamental questions about women today and the sacrifices they have to make."

The film charts Lorna's journey from her teens through to today as a full-time teacher and mother of three, still facing a future dictated by a condition that very few understand, and that medical practitioners often fail to identify.Thathar a’ beachdachadh gu bheil lipoedema a toirt buaidh air mu 300,000 boireannach ann an Alba agus tha Lorna Nic an t-Sagairt air a bhith a’ strì fad a beatha inbheach leis.’S e staid ginteil a th’ ann, far a bheil ceallachan geir neo-àbhaisteach ann am boireannach ag adhbharachadh gu bheil ìre mhòr de chuideam a’ cruinneachadh ann am meadhan a bodhaig.

Dana International won for Israel singing ""Diva"" on the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the state of Israel. She had been at the centre of much media attention in both her country and in the rest of Europe because she was the first openly transgender competitor in the contest. This year marked the last that a Eurovision orchestra was used and the last year with a language restriction. It was also the first year that mass televoting was used instead of the traditional juries.It was FYR Macedonia's debut in the competition after failing to get their 1996 entry past the qualifier judges, while Belgium, Finland, Israel, Romania and Slovakia were all able to return to the competition after their year's exclusion for getting the lowest average scores. The voting was extremely close with Israel, Malta and the United Kingdom all vying for top spot as the final votes were cast. Eventually the UK came in second with Malta a very close third. The contest is also famous for a Eurovision faux-pas. On hearing that the Dutch announcer once performed in the contest, co-host Ulrika Johnson said: ""A long time ago was it?"" provoking laughs and boos from the audience. In fact her seemingly insulting comment was in reply to something Conny van den Bos had said about performing many years ago, although this was lost in the noise from the spectators."

The UK's entry was ""Long Live Love"" by Olivia Newton-John.France had planned to enter the contest and had chosen both singer and song, but ended up withdrawing after the death of their president Georges Pompidou whose funeral was scheduled on the same day as the competition. Meanwhile Italy made headlines for refusing to broadcast the contest on their state TV channel because lyrics in their song ""Si"" (which translates as ""yes"" in English) were judged to possibly have a subliminal effect on voters in a referendum on divorce taking place in Italy the following month. It is reported that Portugal's entry ""E depois do adeus"" was used as a signal by rebel revolutionary soldiers to begin a coup against the Estado Novo regime."

Having nearly lost his life in a stabbing in Brixton 4 years ago, he turned to God and the church of SPAC Nation to save him. He is now inspiring other young people to put down their knives and follow his lead.As part of Enrique’s story we meet other artists whose music is reaching out to young people and inspiring change.

London – the crowning example of the uniquely British inner city mash up of race, class and culture – has been the crucible for a series of original and unique music genres and pop culture lifestyles that have set the world alight. The recipe has been further enriched by contributions from other key urban centres – cities like Bristol and Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. Inspired by the bass heavy rhythms of Jamaican sound systems, fused with the culture, fashion, slang and attitude of the Caribbean, West Africa, Asia and America, fueled by a never-ending soundtrack of pirate radio, and led by successive generations of entrepreneurs, hustlers and maverick visionaries, the whole world has moved to the beats of underground music and club culture made right here, in Britain.  This is the story of Jungle, UKG and Grime – three massive underground music scene that were all ‘Made in Britain.’ These more recent genres exploded from the streets, pirate radio stations and council estates of London and the UK’s inner cities over a period of just a few years in the 1990s. All three gave birth to their own unique sounds, creating a generation of stars, fashions, club scenes and fortunes and all three never quite vanished. Their beats, flows and attitude can still be heard in tunes being made today.  Each episode gives the inside track one of the genres, as told by some of the leading figures who created these underground movements in the first place, in conversation with Ron Samuels, himself a leading light of the original 90s Jungle scene as DJ Ron, and now a documentary director."

Although their conversation covers much about the author's influences and ambitions - with the notable exception of any mention of his time as a spy - much of the interview looks at the modern phenomenon of the secret service agent as a hero.In a revealing insight, le Carre explains that his dislike of James Bond stems from the fact that Bond doesn't exist in a political context, making him more of an ""international gangster"" than a spy. Although Malcolm Muggeridge talks about his own, very brief, period of spying, John le Carre remains close-lipped about his (much more extensive) career in espionage. Le Carre (real name David Cornwell) began working for MI5 in 1952 and transferred to MI6 in 1960. There he remained until 1964, when a combination of Kim Philby's defection, which exposed many British agents, and his own growing success as a novelist caused him to leave the secret service.

The centrepiece of the meal is porchetta, traditionally prepared days ahead by curing it with salt, garlic, sage and rosemary.

Dishes include Farkhanda's shoe kebabs, named because the patties of minced chicken are shaped to resemble shoes. The third and final family to throw open their doors to Andi are the Youngs. Mum Eleanor and Dad Ron are from families that trace their history back to Glasgow as far as anyone can remember. They have three daughters - Amelia, Claudia and Olivia.
